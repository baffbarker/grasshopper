The first toy I'd recommend to play with is from <a href="http://www.d-lusion.com/News.html">D-lusion</a> software. Be a virtual DJ!

My main software host is Steinberg Cubase, embedded inside this si the drum maching Groove Agent, also from Steinberg.

I also play with standalone software from Propellerhead called <a href="http://www.rebirthmuseum.com/">Rebirth</a> which is a software copy of the famous Rolad TR808, TR909, and bass TB303 machines. This interfaces to Cubase via Rewire.

My latest toy is called <a href="http://www.uvisoundsource.com/">UVI Workstation</a> which has fantastic looping abilities.

My keyboard is a Casio CTK811EX midi interface.
