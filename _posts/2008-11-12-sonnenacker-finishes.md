Well this is the end of the season for our "Sonnenacker". As I harvested lettuces and sunflower heads to perhaps use to feed the birds my kids roamed around picking flowers. Next year we'll give them a small patch of their own to cultivate, perhaps a few flowers and whatever. Be fun.<br /><br />I finally used the soil testing kit I bought ages ago on my veg bed and ascertained the pH value to be 7.0 neutral. I understand the ideal to be 6.5 though.
