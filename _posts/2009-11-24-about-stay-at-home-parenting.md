Right then, one of the things I've written about the last few years has been about observance of local traditions. It struck me recently that I've never actually written about the activity which I do here which is actually bringing up kids. I've always written around the subject, but never much about the reality. Perhaps it was connected to the stress of raising them in a foreign land - I wanted to focus on other aspects of the task such as food and the garden. Perhaps it was simply that I didn't feel much pride in the job, owing to the constant pressure. Now that pressure is lifting and I am somewhat in a healthier state of mind, to gain some joy from the job <em>itself.</em>

Let me illustrate. For long I felt Â a failure at parenting, yet as they are older I'm starting to get the reward back. All I've known for years is the nappy table, Aldi/Lidl/Penny supermarket and the kindergarten gate. Now that I am able to get out to socialise a bit I can offload some of the pressure and it is like therapy. In the simple act of a beer in a pub lies <em>in vino veritas</em>, a phrase I've come to recognise.

I'm on about a pride in parenting, not some empty hollow pride born of some task completed without any kind of sacrifice or hardship. It comes in waves, in the midst of all the still ensuing slog.

It's not a foolish arrogant pride, that kind of pride is an empty feeling without substance. It's a pride born of suffering and loneliness, isolation and embarrassing moments of sheer incompetence, of furious tempers lost both adult and child, of tears and laughter, of screams from hurting and giggles from tickling, of occasionally disintegrating sanity and sheer emotional exhaustion.

The task we do as fathers at home is so special in this present time, we mostly do it alone, with very little social support from the outside world. Mothers, even single mothers, have an instinctive bond with each other where many of us men have very little.

I write this because an internet friend I've "known" for years said I had beautiful kids when I sent her photos and it almost made me cry. Something in my own life had gone finally right.

It's only after a long exhausting fug of years of isolation and often boredom that when the youngest becomes "clean", the long-held mists of exhaustion start to life like clouds off a mountain and a tiny crack of perspective begins to make itself apparent. What shines through is an unbelievable feeling.

....then its back to another messy floor to be cleaned up!
