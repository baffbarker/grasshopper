Great news is that the VMAP CD arrived yesterday here from David Cantrell in London. This has saved a huge download time from the web.<br /><br /><br />I now have:<br />Landsat imagery<br />VMAP<br />DCW<br />River network<br /><br />Yet to download:<br />SRTM data<br /><br />I thought of writing a short summary of how useful these data are for this blog for those interested. Maybe later.<br /><br />Coolest discovery yesterday was the Chicago Street Crime map which looked so professional. Very impressive.
