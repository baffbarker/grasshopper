This is the first posting of the above idea. It is inspired by an article in the Guardian I read a few weeks ago <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,,1453293,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,,1453293,00.html</a> and led me to the Free Map Project at <a href="http://www.free-map.org.uk/">http://www.free-map.org.uk/</a> and will atempt to do the following:<br /><br />Provide free maps for all of Munich starting with a special app - Perlacher Forst Running routes<br /><br />To this end I have downloaded and installed Mapserver at home to learn how it works.<br /><br />then -<br /><br />Get my old Magellan system working<br />Landsat 7 images of the city free via USGS and GRASS<br />SRTM height data<br />GPS collected waypoints by me<br />Appeals through websites like Toytown to collect waypoints on roads
