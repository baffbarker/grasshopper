Tonight's attempt to vary the cauliflower recipe repertoire (one - cauliflower cheese) as a Delia Smith one out of her "How To Cook" book - a soup with potatoes and onions laced with parmesan. Yum!<br /><br />All munched with Foccaccia using garden herbs rosemary and marjoram.<br /><br />Yesterday I was at "Firma Wenig" to get the apples from our tree juiced. Three crates gave us 14 litres of still warm sterilised juice. It sank well that evening with cauliflower cheese using spuds and cauli from the Sonnenacker. The grape harvest was 9.5kg - dying to turn it into wine! The plums were poor this year - Won't be making that wine which tasted like sherry this year then.
