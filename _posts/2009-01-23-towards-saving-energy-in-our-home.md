<p align="left">Took a while, but I recently sifted through our gas amd electricity bills to ascertain our annual use of these utilities. I've put them in the table below:</p>Pardon my poor HTML skills.<br /><br />Upon reading our bills I came across in small print how much CO2 we emitted in that year and also somewhat alarmingly how much nuclear waste we genereted!<br /><br />I've had sick kids to look after recently so havent been very active. <br /><br />I obtained weather data from my local weather station and used Open Office's Calc to figure out how many "day degrees" we experienced here in my home town. I shall publish that info as soon as I have it.<br /><br /><table border="1" align="left"><br /><tbody><tr><br /><th>Year</th><br /><th>Electric (kWh)</th><br /><th>Gas (kWh)</th><br /><th>Gas (m3)</th><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td>2008</td><br /><td>5969</td><br /><td>19983</td><br /><td>2004</td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td>2007</td><br /><td>5181</td><br /><td>20297</td><br /><td>2036</td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td>2006</td><br /><td>5274</td><br /><td>30468</td><br /><td>3056</td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td>2005 (Oct-Dec)</td><br /><td>797</td><br /><td>4752</td><br /><td>477</td><br /></tr><br /></tbody></table>
