...with a camera that is.

Having just watched actor Richard E Grant describing the history of safari in Africa and having indulged myself in the Masai Mara, where I took the same balloon safari he did and experienced the same thrills, also tracking tigers in Bandavgarh in central India with the heir to the throne of Nepal, and spotted gazelles in the Tuwaiq deep in central Saudi Arabia, I found this a fascinating subject. The wife's grandfather was something of a shot himself in Bavaria and trophies of his adorn the walls of the family weekend place. Although unable to shoot an animal, I was a an angler as a youth so find the country sports thing interesting if cruel. A complex area.

The most fascinating was actually a safari lodge run by Maasai themselves. It is good to see them gaining from such a dark past. Although dark, it is somewhat fascinating when you are deep in these lands and come across a white descendant of the original settlers. Even more when you listen to their stories of their years in these inhospitable places.

Has anyone else had this experience of safari or the old colonial life?
