To be honest, having overlaid the vectors on the Landsat data I am not impressed with the data quality of thesed lines. But perhaps I have been too spoiled with photogrammetric 1:1000 mapping the past few years. Working in the Microstation domain may be bad for you in thast you are closer to the GIS holy grail of extreme accuracy which is always craved but never often achieved.<br /><br />Must note the existence of people who are pursuing similar projects. Benoit Veler in France is doing a GIS of the whole Alps region. Ehud Shabtai is doing a map of Tel Aviv. So goo to know I am not alone. Hopefully this home web mappign stuff spreads.....<br /><br />I must thank two kind people. David Cantrell in London for his kindness in sending useful CDs to me. Additionally Jeffrey Johnson has sent me SRTM data. Thanks once again to these kind people.<br /><br /><TABLE border='0' cellspacing='0'><TR><TD><a href='http://www.pph-net.org'><img border='0' src='http://flaxmanconsultancy.com/counters/countme.php?count=http://wherethehellisit.blogspot.com/' alt='Remodulin'></a></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><font size='xx-small'><a href='http://www.pph-net.org'>Remodulin</a></font></TD></TR></TABLE>
