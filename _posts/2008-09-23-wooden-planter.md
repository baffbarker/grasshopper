The council or "Gemeinde" sent us a letter to tell us to cut back our hazel tree, so Saturday saw action on that front, but not without saving some decent branches, as inspired by <a href="http://www.allotmentforestry.com/articles/swaac2002.htm">this website </a>. Next year I hope to build some nice arches for my sweet peas which were a star this year in the garden.<br /><br />Down by the green waste composting area of Vivo I found a lovely big wooden planter which will likely hold a nice Oleander next year.
