This post was initiated by a Facebook message from an old mate Terry Taylor.

It's to my knowledge an old reservoir to supply water to cool the quarry in Llandulas below, but to us teenagers it was a magical place, an escape from the aggressive environment of school. So much is said about teenagers these days as though they're the lowest form of life, yet all of us who turned up there some kind of spell came upon us when we arrived, as we all went quiet, spying the weeds below for those wonderful dark shapes of small carp and tench which used to sunbathe on those hot days. One sudden move and they vanished, leaving a boiling wave which rippled across the pool, whose wide wavelengths betrayed the large size of these fish and the power hidden in their flanks.

There were fifteen fishing spots or "pegs" as we called them, each had their own mini challenges. Peg 1 and 2 were the luxury ones as they had concrete squares to lay out your gear so it wouldn't get muddy, and lo! a metal hole to put in your umbrella. A fishing umbrella in those days before evil Thatcherite greed gripped everyone was the height of luxury to us, and those who owned one to shelter from the frequent rains were the envy of others.  Peg 9 was also a great spot, to the right was a patch of weeds which had a small yard (not metres) square in which one might carefully cast ones two foot depth float with perhaps a worm or a maggot (bought from Stan's or Phil's of course). My favourite was a very cheap "Carbonyte" black tiny waggler float bought from Woolworths  "Winfield" fishing tackle section (I used to spend hours after school gazing at the stuff there). Peg 13 was also good for perch, but a bit narrow. Peg 14 was also near to the best spot of all....

But the most coveted peg was "15". There was always a race to get that spot. The breathless race across the field would be greeted with dismay when a regular was seen, but despair when a day ticket holder -  a foreigner - sat there. They'd have no idea of its secrets!

I spent hours on that spot. I caught a record breaking tench on that spot just after a thunderstorm, I still remember the extra quarter on the end "One pound fourteen ounces and a quarter" . I also had a trophy for  a crucian carp. At ten ounces, it was no Redmire "biggie" but the baby crucians in the pool were real joys to behold when caught.

One summer there seemed to be a lot of fish dying and in their infinite wisdom the committee decided to hold a "working party" and clear the weeds from the whole pool, believing it to be the cause. However they didn't finish the job, and peg 15 was left unmolested. Guess who drew the peg in the summer matches? From 6pm to 9pm a small foot depth float was cast into the maelstrom of feeding crazy tench who would see the bait sinking, then swoop upon it and battle against my rod, to an awaiting landing net then the keep net. After dozens of fish a slimy mass of fish were emptied into the white wire basket then weighed. Ten and three-quarters pounds  of fish! I still remember the praise of those around me and the high of achievement and praise. Lord knows I never got much in my somewhat miserable existence as a teenager. It stands as a highpoint in my early life. So people my know why that pond holds  a special place in my heart.

(Thanks Terry for bringing up those happy memories!)
