<p>When you were sat in a pub and the local thug accused you of "spilling his pint" this was the threat he made. </p><p>According to the Guardian, they've spent 54m quid trying to improve hospital food in the UK: </p><p>http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/22/54million-20-years-hospital-food</p><p>I remember an interesting James Martin programme a year ago where he tried to improve the quality of food in Scarborough Hospital. To my horror I saw how they were originally serving FROZEN omelettes, yet he waded in and changed the whole culture. </p><p>This is somewhat poignant for me as I have approached the local elderly care home and offered to design a kitchen garden for them. Was due to meet them this week, but was still suffering from my awful flu so wasn't yet ready to start discussions.</p>
