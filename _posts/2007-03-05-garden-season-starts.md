Yesterday (Sunday) strated to dig the new veg beds. Must write down which they are.<br /><br />Bought expensive Hortensia (Expensia) from Tegernsee from two wiimin. Made a list of German plant names to translate here.<br /><br />Today (Monday) Sowed lots of seeds I bought in Aldi and Penny and had from the previous tenant in this house.
