Unfortunately he breaks them up but he told me to come back in 3-4 weeks and he'd save me some.<br /><br />New BBC Gardener's World presenter tonight. Seems promising as he built up a harden from recycled materials so let's see. Poor old Monty, much missed.<br /><br />Seem to spend a lot of time on treehugger.com nowadays.
