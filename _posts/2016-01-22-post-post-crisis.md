Yesterday I was chatting with a friend about a small business opportunity which came my way but I decided not to undertake, secondarily out of yes fear of the unknown but the primary reason was that I'm in Europe, living between two ice floes (there's a cool blog by that name). One is an individualistic culture, always "out there". The other is a serf culture which hasn't shifted since the Middle Ages. Guess which one I live in? The bombastic idea that I strike out alone, with limited resources, scraping something together and building something up by blood and sweat (also in today's world you have to have that Dale Carnegie "Influence People" mentality). On a deeper level it's a Marxist state-takes-care-of-all mentality versus a libertarian self-reliant philosophy. My parents and I inherited that frontier way of thinking from our ancestors. I marvel at the industry they both deployed buying a house in deep France, clearing so much dirt away, living as they(I also) did in a scruffy caravan a month with no showers (we were black at the end) renovating a barn, all at over sixty.

When I flew to Saudi I had their inertia to deal with. The Arab mentality lets be charitable, does not value original thought. I had to passionately build up may mapping lab bit by bit, purchase software, plotters and know how all on my own. There is something in our DNA which drives us on ever onwards.

I hear of these so-called cool Berlin startups. Now for the last decade can you think of a single "app" which has come out of Europe which has swept the world? Where did all the game changers come from? Facebook? Google? Twitter? That's right they are all products of Anglo-Saxon thinking, questioning, destroying, rebuilding. None of the biggies the last few years came out of Europe. The only exception might be Linus Torvalds Linux, but even then his genius flew over the Atlantic to the West where the libertarians like Stallman took the baby and grafted it onto Unix.

When German companies are doing well the icing on the cake for them is to bring in foreign (Anglo Saxon) talent. They all fly in US/UK managers to bring in the original thinking. They know we come in, work 60 hour weeks and put our souls into what we do, don't go home at exactly 5pm (as that's what all good Germans do, remember Kirche Kaffee, Kuchen). One of the big things these firms do is install satellite dishes for their expats. There have been very few dishes installed the last few years. The expat dish is the canary in the coalmine of how well Germany is doing.

This land will always be a serf mentality land. The attitudes I talk of are so deeply inherent and passed on to the offspring that it will probably never recover here.

As to the advice in the Slogpost, learn a language - as a matter of fact I am learning advanced German but the material is such shite it makes me depressed. One is a German novel by Bernard Schlink. Its tough going but the subject is yes the Holocaust. It's as though I teach English through a novel written set in Abu Ghraib.

I'm learning a different type of language - Java. That's quite rewarding but difficult to see where it will lead for me.

I guess the answer is to create something, but what that is is up for grabs as a notion.
