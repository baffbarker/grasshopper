I haven't lost faith with this idea yet.<br /><br />The biggest pain with a project of this kind is the huge up- and down-loads of free data. This can wreyk havoc on the phone bills with a Gigbyte limit when you are downloading 300mb images sometimes. so now we are upgrading to flatrate with German telecom, expect some more movement in this little pet project.
