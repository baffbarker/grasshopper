Last night I managed to get the software going! Don't ask how I just sort of remembered old commands and it ran! I would describe my approach to GIS as similar to that of McGyver! I just improvise and it often works! But it also often doesn't!<br /><br />Next steps will be to check out other datasets and to learn Mapserver. Also to startthinking of where tzo serve this data. Ask on TT if anyone knows of a Server where I might place this.<br /><br />Emailed Nick Whiteledd to ask if he used the river data. Asked about experiences of SRTM data.
