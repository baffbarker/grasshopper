So I attempted to utilise an old telescope tripod, some old bolts I had lying around in my cellar and cut a piece of old cupboard I found in the scrap wood at the local recycling centre. Â Several problems were encountered.

First the tripod head was earlier an old equatorial scope head and had lots of oil on the top, making it rather unpleasant to operate. I have also a camera tripod which may be more suitable.

Second, cutting the plane table itself proved tough using a jigsaw - it looks horribly ziggy zaggy with regards to the straight cut I wanted.

Finally, the alidade was hard to develop. As you can see I cut out a long strip to make perhaps a ruler to draw along. Again, with the poor cut of the jigsaw this was hard to achieve.

All in all my first attempt to build a plane table is wobbly and looks something like out if a Bruce Forsyth Generation Game two minute challenge!

Can anyone send me some unused gear?
