Why Walden Two?

In 1854 Henrry David Thoreau published "Walden" an account of life in the woods in rural Connecticut. He upped sticks and went to live as simply as possible on the shores of Walden Pond. He wrote a treatise on how to live as purely as possible away from the disctractions of urban life, in his case it weas the railway and not the Internet which is our modern disctraction.

The idea came to me during a recent phase of decluttering, which was inspired by articles I read about <a href="http://cheapgreenrvliving.com/Page_Index.html">living in small spaces in caravans and camper vans</a>. Parallel to that I was fascinated by the capsule which took Felix Baumgartner up to space during the <a href="http://www.redbullstratos.com/">Red Bull Stratos</a> Project, and the life support systems built into the tiny human craft. I blithely compared them to the life support systems present in my caravan. Kevin McCloud of "Grand Designs" fame ran a series where he <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/kevin-mcclouds-man-made-home">built a hand built hut</a> in the forest too. Further reading of the website triggered off the "decluttering" project, which led to a <a href="http://www.toytowngermany.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=274468">new thread</a> on the Toytown discussion forum.

We can't all go off and build a log cabin in the woods, but I believe we can learn to reduce stress in the modern world. Shown below is the mind map I have developed to achieve this.

I can report since starting "decluttering" that I do indeed have a calmer mind, and have opened up somee creative space in which I get more done at home. Key to this was reducing addiction, not an "addiction" in any serious way, yet rather developing an awareness of avoidance strategies I deploy to take my mind away from stuff I don't want to do or issues I don't want to face.
