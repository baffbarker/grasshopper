I maintain several blogs. My first ever was a free mapping blog in an attempt to keep my hand in when I lost my digital mapping job. I am an amateur astronomer and maintain one called Starhopping when I am out with my telescope. However for those who read this blog of more interest is myother blog "<a href="http://www.womblinfree.blogspot.com/">Womblin' Free</a>" which details my daily jaunts round various waste sites and some of the amazing things I've found in them such as telescopes, cafetieres and stickers for children. Recently I've started to see links between my interests. It seems many who are into gardening are naturally into cookery, and also composting and recycling. 'Tis but a short leap into the world of alternative power, and it is to this awakening interest we now turn our attention. <br /><br />Last night thanks to a fantastic <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Cardboard-Savonius-turbine/">Instructable</a> I had my first ever try at making a wind turbine. Unbelievably simple and fun, the cutting took half an hour. My daughter who loves to cut and paste got a bit upset with me as I got cross with her as she messed up cutting a circle out of card for me. Never mind. I mounted it on a long two foot rhreaded lentgh of metal I had lying around and rushed up to out loft and dug out an electric fan. Success! It's only card but it's a start. Next fun task will be to mount it on our balcony.<br /><br />Caught the end of GW last night and despite others' <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/gardenersworld/2008/09/first_thoughts.html">comments</a> I rather liked Toby's practical advice and tips. I have been moaning for ages with my wife that they never show how to do basic things at all, just do long articles on someone's specialist gyacinth collection or whatever. Toby gives clear down to earth back to nasics help which is just what we newer clueless gardeners need.
