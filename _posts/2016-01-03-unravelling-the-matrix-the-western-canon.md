Right then,

&nbsp;

As I read deeper into Martin Keerns' wonderful trilogy of why everything is shit (and while my son listens to Sylvester and Tweetie Pie in my ears) I am attempting to reflect on why everything is so shit. It has been shit about 150 years it seems and what's more evil it seems it was made Shit on purpose by the Rockefellers and their clan. Nope no conspiracy it is real, and the sooner you wake up from your woken sleep the better.

For alongside my set projects of ongoing health in the form of teaching myself web coding (far harder than they say it is), daily practice of Qi Gong (the Gong or Kung means constant practice) I've decided as a new resolution to enter the Great Conversation. This means having a crack at the Great Books - yeah the Tolstoys, Cervantes, the Bible, even Shakey (yes even Shakin Stevens had something to say on the modern condition).

In order to undertake that you need to know the liberal arts and that is the Trivium. It fell into place lately as I'd heard of this through the amazing Jan Irwin site Gnosticmedia.com but didn't understand it or rather how I might apply it to learning anything. The liberal arts offer a way into the great ideas through the following food-related metaphors:
<ol>
	<li>Taste - take an overview of the body of work/knowledge</li>
	<li>Chew - digest parts of that whole to gain slightly deeper impressions</li>
	<li>Swallow - understand enough that you "speak" the language of the body of work to develop your own themes.</li>
</ol>
So this is my new year idea, and given I do the other ongoing things has a chance of slowly trickling along piece by piece.
