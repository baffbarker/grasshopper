<strong>WINTER</strong>

Winter grips us with icy fingers
Grey and cold bring death to our thoughts.
Darkness and gloom fill our empty voids,
And spring is just a memory away.
Orion and Sirius rise and hunt across the sky
Clear jewels sparkle in an icy black nowhere.


<strong>SPRING</strong>

Spring yields us optimism awakening and rebirth
Life renewed as a baby smiles.
The icy snowballls in Hercules
Sparkle like frosty jewels in space.
The planting of a seed is a statement of hope
Of warm balmy days yet to come.


<strong>SUMMER</strong>

Pagan fires are lit on montain tops
Telling of customs in antiquity still running deep.
Hot days sizzle and wear us down
Till thunder cleans the damp air away.
Predators eat away at our green labours
To remind us we must have with our sunshine but some rain.


<strong>AUTUMN</strong>

Gather harvests before the cold comes
That we may eat when all is scarce.
Red orange and yellow fires all the senses
Then the leaves suddenly drop.
The Pleiades tell us Orion is coming,
And the cycle begins again.
