Right then, 

That title scared you dinnit?

I'm going to give you a timeline which shows, without any kind of conspiracy theory, what has ha√ºpened in the UK. I want you to thiknk about this and discuss it below. This is a timeline based upon my direct preceived experience growing up in the 1970s, to now. Look upon this as a war between two resources, coal and oil. 

Coal was the base resource which built the British Empire, powered the trains which steamed across Britain to connect it together. One of the great things about the old geography before the so-called "Quantification Revolution" in my subject came along was that you drew pencil maps of where all the coal, oil and rubnbber was in the world. All that died when they changed our syllabuses (or is it syllabi?)

Here is a timeline which meshes my direct experiences with known events.

1945 - Bitter Lake, Suez Canal, King Ibn Saud Abdul Aziz agrees with Roosevelt to secure the Kingdom's oil for arms.

1953 - my Dad's coal business goes bankrupt.

1963 - Dr Beeching "reshapes" Britain's railway network. Unsurprisingly the road network booms.

1978 - I have to leave my home owing to a huge dual carriageway being built across my garden in my Welsh village.

1984 - Brutal British coal strike. Thatcher buys coal from Poland, mined with children's hands so it is cheaper. British pits are destroyed as they are "uneconomic".

Dots joining?
