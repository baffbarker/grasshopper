What even better about this morning's delivery is that the chap who cut it split it at exactly the right width! so often I have to split each log in half in order to burn it on my fire! The pic shows "Zwei sterr" of wood - two cubic metres. That cost me 120 Euros. We will be taking delivery in May of 4 more cubic metres, to allow the wood plenty of time over the summer to dry out nicely.

It's long been a dream of mine to make a short documentary based around the amazing PDF I downloaded called "Splitting Firewood" a treatise on this vital subject which I downloaded a while back (it's sister publication is a fascinating book on the art of the scythe).
