Lovely elevation values rules file already available in GRASS.</p><br /><br />Tonight's job is to develop the vector layers from VMAP. I shall determine the lat and long values either via the NIMA GEOTRANS software or maybe there is an easier way via a metadata file. Then finally imprt it into my GRASS GIS!<br /><br />Breaking News! GRASS6.0.1 is out. Priority is to download it onto my PC.<br /><br />Breaking breaking news! No the binaries for Windows are not yet available! Wait a few days!<br /><br />Priority for VMAP data is to extract for the bounding rectangle enclosing our region of interest.<br /><br />The extent values we need to enter into NIMAMUSE are:<br /><br />north: +48.4229068<br />west:   +9.5507659<br />east:  +12.5572328<br />south: +46.4773112<br /><br />in lat long wgs84 coords.<br /><br />So now we download GEOTRANS from NIMA. 7 megs...takes a while.<br /><br />Oh bummer coords are in dec degrees. I can't be bothered to convert so we shall live with these. We do not need accuracy at the edges anyway.<br /><br />So back we go to the VPF Importer. This time equipped with the extents.<br /><br />Hydrography - rivers and lakes are done.<br />Physiography - ice fields - useful.<br /><br />As of tonight all data layers are in the GIS.
