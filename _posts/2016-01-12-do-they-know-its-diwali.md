Dawn, Bombay 2045. Shocked at how low his former colonizers have sunk, Bob Singh sees a TV documentary on how a recent combined HAARP/chemtrail attack on Europe causes a million trees to blow down in the richest lands of Europe, in Bavaria. Bob is a decent Indian Sikh, an individual who made it big during the massive global dominance of Bollywood which came of age during the 2020s. Slightly naff conservative Bombay films which featured eternal dancing and singing megacasts gave way to more sensible mature social commentaries on Indian life.

He rings around his old band mates in Bombay and asks them did they see the same documentary. Europe is now an unsafe place to visit, Anarchy has broken out as law and order have broken down. People live in self-built enclaves and the very rich live in walled compounds for their own safety as feral roam the streets at night. Once the subject of endless "reality shows" the masses are now left to their own devices. Bob hears of that old Band Aid song and decides to rewrite it to raise money among the megarich in India for the poor in Europe. After all, following the oil collapse in 2020, the est rapidly sank into an abyss from which it would never recover. Here are the lyrics he revises:

<em>It's Diwali time; there's no need to be being afraid </em>
<em>At Diwali time, we let in light and we banish shade</em>

<em>And in our world of blenty we can spread a smile of joy </em>
<em>Throw your arms around the west at Diwali time </em>

<em>But say a puja to pray for the other ones </em>
<em>At Diwali time </em>
<em>It's hard, but when you're having fun </em>

<em>There's a world outside your window </em>
<em>And it's a world of dread and pain</em>

<em>Where the only water flowing is the bitter acid rain </em>

<em>And the Christmas bells that ring there </em>
<em>Are the clanging chimes of doom </em>

<em>Well tonight thank Vishnu it's them instead of you </em>

<em>And there won't be snow in Europe this Diwali time </em>

<em>The greatest gift they'll get this year is life </em>

<em>Oh, where nothing ever grows, where chemtrails blow </em>

<em>Do they know it's Diwali time at all?</em>

<em>Here's to you, raise a glass for ev'ry guy </em>

<em>Here's to them, underneath that dirty sky </em>

<em>Do they know it's Diwali time at all? </em>

<em>Feed the world </em>
<em>Feed the world </em>

<em>Feed the world </em>
<em>Let them know it's Diwalitime</em>
<em>Feed the world </em>
<em>Let them know it's Diwalitime</em>
