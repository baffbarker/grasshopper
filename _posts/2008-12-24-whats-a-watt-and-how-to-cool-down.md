<p>Okay three things came up in my questions of how to train. </p><p>The warm up I did was tzhat nice yoga stretch taught to me by a pretty American in Kathmandu on the rooftop of a backpackers hotel. To be honest it stsrted to get a bit hard. Ten years of ageing havent helped.</p><p>But how on earth does one cool down with this blasted thing? It has this "Erholung" button but buggered if I can figure it out. Bit more reading.</p><p>Watts measure resistance in training. Google should work here.</p>
