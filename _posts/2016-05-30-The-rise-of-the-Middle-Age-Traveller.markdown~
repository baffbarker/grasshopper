Right then,

If you were one of those who did the "Dordogne Dream" in the 1980s you'll have an acquaintance with France and the mini-propety boom which ensued as we Brits bought up old ruins and renovated them. The French on their side, saw just ramshackle old barns and weed filled land which they were only too happy to get rid of. This surge back in the 90s is no longer so. For it seems there is another kind of invasion underway across France, with couples driving vans the same colour as their hair across the land.

I have just returned from an awesome holiday in my tiny caravan touring France. For us it was a test to regain faith in the car and van as we've had some disasters, partly of my own making not checking tyres enough and yeah....driving too fast! Our main regions are France and Spain. We usually don't take a site the first night rather stay in a motorway rest stop, buy croissants then drive on to where we put down on a site for the night.

Here is our lst of fave sites:
