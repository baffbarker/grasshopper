Right then,<br /><br />The January birth of my son, a metre of snow in my Bavarian back garden and a bitter minus ten winter have prevented any outdoor astronomy. Now we have Spring at 7 degrees the patio is just a  footstep away. And what do we have here - Praesepe - M44 or the Beehive cluster. Beautiful formation in binoculars with Saturn nearby.<br /><br />Time to dig out the ETX again too....
