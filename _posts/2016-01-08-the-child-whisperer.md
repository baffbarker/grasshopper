Last night I undertook something I'd heard of for a long time, which I never understood, known as operant conditioning. I had a situation we all know well, trying to get my hyper son into bed to sleep. I heard him getting on my daughter's nerves, playing with their cuddly toys giggling, then I gently walked up to him, stroked his hair and said "bed" and walked away. At first nothing happened. I calmly repeated the action a few minutes later then he began to notice. After a while he got up and I jokily pushed him towards the bathroom to brush his teeth*. Tickles later he was busy teethy cleaning then joined me for story time. More nonsense by lying at the foot of the bed, still calm on my side. Up to me for a nice story and minutes later sleep. What happened there?

I'm reading about Skinner behaviour psychology at the moment and keeping the farm calm. It I think goes back to Monty Roberts Horse Whisperer, Dr Doolittle and even as far back as the Essenes of Christ's time, a tribe who were able to "talk to the animals". It seems to me, that were one able to undertake the taming of animals using non threatening methods, one might be seen to have magical powers.

Here is the original Horse Whisperer Monty Roberts:

*No tempers were lost in the course of this action.
