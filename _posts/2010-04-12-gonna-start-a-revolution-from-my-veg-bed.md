So sang Liam Galagher in 1997 on What's the Story (Morning Glory)? Or not. But with an extremely tedious UK election looming and having been abroad so long - about fifteen years - the only way I actually see a way to make any difference in your life is to try to "be the change", to become as self sufficient as possible. I've tried a <em>Sonnenacker</em> German style allotment the last two years but it needed petrol to get to, was difficult to water and ended up full of weeds, so the logical thing to do was to chop down two old-and-excess-to-requirements plum trees last autumn and build a raised veg bed on top.

The project started with registering for a <em>Häckselaktion</em> a rather cool offer from the local <em>Gemeinde</em> (council) where they shred your tree prunings for 15 minutes for free.

I woke up one morning at 7.45 to this loud noise. No small garden shredder this, was positively street-blockingly enormous! Some cars couldn't get past, indeed some German cow screamed at me like it was my fault they'd parked across the whole street.

I ended up with a huge pile of shredded material on my drive thus:

Immediate help from the kids thus shifted it into the garden. Bring back child labour:

You may be able to make out the beginnings of a "horsehoe" shape permaculture bed. It's essentially a long bed curled round to maximise space yet allow access to the middle. So I designed it (a rather grand way of saying I improvised it) to have wooden walls in the end. Initially I tried walls made from the old trunks of the knocked down plum trees, but the look from the wife gave the answer so for about 100 Euros from the <em>baumarkt</em> for timber I had all the stuff for a foot (30cm) high raised bed. The overall area was 4.5m by 3m, so it needed an access point in the middle. The outer walls were straightforward to build yet the inner path took a bit of thinking, not easy with kids wrecking the rest of the garden, digging the odd hole in the lawn and the neighbours' daughter screaming on the trampoline.

Following Toby Hemenway's advice in <a href="http://www.patternliteracy.com/">Gaia's Garden</a> I developed a "lasagne" style bed, starting with old cardboard at the bottom to suppress weeds, then on top the shreddings - about a cubic metre. A chance comment with one of the Omas at the kindergarden, who owns a <em>gärtnerei</em> led to a trailer load of horsey plop of a year old vintage, which was surprisingly odour free. I went down with the two kids and we loaded up the trailer. The event was tarnished by the accidental throwing of muck by my son over my daughter, al in my poor girl's hair and on her coat! I was thus reminded of that famous song by the <a href="http://www.theyetties.co.uk/index.php?&amp;dx=1&amp;ob=3&amp;rpn=index&amp;sid=570a63875b5f537a617c194e068c60e0">Yetties of Yetminster</a>:

<em>"Fling it here, fling it there.
If you're standing by then you'll all get your share."</em>

I mean with quality lyrics like that they'd beat the hell out of the Wurzels.

So upon return the bed was filled with fine plop. The final layer needed was a load of topsoil. A half hour with Carl my neighbour taught me so much about raised beds - he being a farmer and forester couldn't resist coming over for a nose round and I thus probed him for tips and info. I learnt so much in that short time. So the next thing was to go out and search for a building site where topsoil was being scraped off, or some such. My first attempt was a quarry, but the bloke there wasn't that friendly and I had to spade in all the soil myself as he moaned that soil would make his digger dirty for shifting gravel which was his normal job. So another idea came to me today - just drive round the town and find a big JCB digger and ask. As luck would have it I found a bloke levelling a field who said I could have some and home I drove to fetch my trailer. A good hour later the stuff was settling nicely in my newly built veg bed with wooden sides:

So there we have it. Took a while and still needs a bit more topsoil but this will hopefully feed us this summer salads, cabbage, maybe tomatoes, the lot. The other bed will also be used - it's indeed sprouting up some garlic which I planted last year and forgot about - evidently the ice cold winter helped the bulbs to open up this spring. The plan is to follow a <a href="http://www.chelseagreen.com/content/start-a-polyculture-now-toss-a-salad-tomorrow/">Ianto Evans style polyculture</a>. I shall blog about the experience when we start after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Saints">Eisheiligen</a>. Work in the garden on tender plants cannot start until these days are out of the way.
