Right then,

Whilst reading "down the Rabbit Hole" I came across a great site <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/">sacredtexts.com</a>Â which contains fascinating material on the Great Faiths. I think we are at the cusp of a war, a war not against Islam but against Satan and his acolytes. Time for some Thin Lizzy! Here are the lyrics:

Holy War - Thin Lizzy

If you will adore me
Bow before me and praise my name
If you place no god before me
Then all I have is yours to claim

And if God is in the heavens
Why did God let children die
If you don't ask these questions
There is no reasons why

[Chorus]
We are chosen
We are one
We are frightened of no one
And no one will win this war
This is the way
This is the law

All the visions shown before you
All the kingdoms and the thrones
All are yours if you bow before me and adore me
All this you can own

There are those that will go to Heaven
There are those that will never win
No one knows what will happen
There are those that turn to sin

[Chorus: x2]

We are chosen

The devil is in hell with the demons
This is the Holy War

They lead us to our temptation
Lead us, take our souls
There is no evil in salvation
There is evil in us all

Just as Satan tempted Jesus
And Jesus slips and falls
He is a station on The Cross now
He is dying to save us all

[Chorus: x2]

We are chosen
We are one
We are frightened of no one
And no one will win this war
This is the way
