I am really bothered by the comment Harry made regarding killing in Afghanistan. A lot was riding on that interview. The Matrix/Illuminati are desperate for a hero, they need fresh blood to join up and Harry is their poster boy.

In the light of the CBS interview I checked the workding of his interview and something stank. Harry did not explicitly say he had killed in Afghanistan.

Here's my take: Harry is only a half royal, i.e., his father is that Hewitt chap. He shows signs of rebellion and is "dangerous" to the crown image. If he is seen saying stuff like this then the Taleban may of course be angered. Later we may see an attempt on his life, "apparently" by the Taleban but of course we Cryptome readers know different.....

He is imho more at risk from rogue elements within his own party than the Taleban. I think he is a decent bloke popular with the people and a rebel. We know what happened to the last "popular rebel don't we?Â  GET OUT OF AFGHANISTAN HARRY!
