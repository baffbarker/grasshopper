<p>I have just watched a video which went viral on the Internet and received 3.5 million hits. I could not follow the biochemistry easily but I stayed with it till the recommendations came which follow below. My lifestyle is such that I gave up alcohol 9 months ago and have been a member of a gym 3 years, yet am no less fat than I used to be! Given we are a family who exercise perhaps above average - we downhill- and cross-country- ski in winter, and mountain bike in summer, it must be thus something else. I notice that I replaced alcohol with alcohol free beer in the evenings, and have developed a sweet tooth so this video is helping to understand why I did that. </p><p>Here is the video and here are the recommendations:</p><p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM</p><p>Get rid of all sugared liquids - drink only water and milk</p><p>Eat carbohydrate with flour</p><p>Wait 20 minutes for second portions</p><p>Buy your screen time minute for minute with physical activity</p><p> </p><p>Here are the steps I am gong to take in our case:</p><p>Cut out cereal products - no bread, pasta, potatoes (jesus) - that will be hard!</p><p>Drink fart water (soda stream water) in the evenings. Not even alcohol free beer.</p><p>Cut out sweets completely!</p><p>Weirdly I think the gym is unhealthy! There is fresh air out there, trails to bike and run, and also get in a yoga class.</p><p>I'm also going to attempt to get onto the paleo diet which seems like a radical change to our lives foodwise. Seems to be the way to go.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hypertension?</p><p>Paleo Diet?</p>
