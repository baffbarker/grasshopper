This is a humble attempt to describe my newfound status as a member of The Call Club. It refers to those who are expats overseas and (often late night) receive the phone call they never ever want to hear.

My mother's passing has dragged me into a new club with a whole new vocabulary and a new world view. Entering that club is a bit like when you are a 17 year old, being let into a pub full of adults. I am now supposed to be an adult. But I feel unworthy of this new label. Heaven knows it is a club I never ever wanted top be in.
