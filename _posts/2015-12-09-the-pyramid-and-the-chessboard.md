I started wondering about symbology recently, thanks to the Vigilant Citizen website. Those who know use symbols and numbers to communicate. My local Hexal and Sandoz firms logos are a cross and a pyramid so I got wondering.

The study of symbols is known as semiotics, and there's a course in it at Aberystwyth University:

my take is that symbols became of significance after the Tower of Babel era when tribes split into different languages, and symbols were the only way for the elite to communicate with each other.

The pyramid has as it sfocus the All Seeing Eye but IMHO that is just a red herring. The real power lies in the base!
