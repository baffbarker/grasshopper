Following John Ward's relentless analysis of our ever hateful British Government and its shenanigans, the thing which strikes me is thanks to the Internet, some of us are discovering our fundamental mistake .- surrendering power to the State. By State I mean either the multinational, the government, the local small badly run company, any organised entity you'd rather not mix with but have to or you will lose your home. Now I think that's is the crisis everyone comes up against at some point or another, the realization that the organization one sacrificed so much for in the past is a castle on sand. I think this applies to religion too.

I believe the book of Luke captures most of what Jesus taught, and the message is actually I believe everything but the church wants us to understand. I think the battle we all face in the modern age is a battle which has been fought for generations, the individual against the collective. And in this internet age I think the time is ripe for the second coming. Not any CNN televised beam down from space white bloke landing on earth type media spectacular, but the realization that the Christ is actually within every living soul.

If that's what JC taught on the Mount, no wonder the Holy Roman Church came along and bottled up his message and made it theirs to control the sheep. No wonder Martin Luther came long and wrote his tracts which broke the monopoly spell the paedo priests had on the people. Mind you their Protestant faith became a victim of its own success in turn.

I was reading of a revolution in space lately - picosatellites. Tiny 10cm cubes will be launched into space which will revolutionize communications. Already high altitude ballooning is a kind of known sport where balloons fly to 100,000 feet, but the tiny sats which may beam stuff to earth look to end the Murdopoly we've suffered for too long. No more hacked murdered girls phones! I have yet to know where the Clarke Belt is but it may be that one day it will be full of sat channels way better than his tacky telly stations, all beamed down by amateur broadcasters.

Now then why is this a game changer? Well, remember in 1976 when the Sex Pistols screamed and snarled on stage? They were the beginning of a movement which broke up the record business monopoly. Ironically hanging on the coat-tails of Richard Branson's Virgin label, Â the led the way where music could be created by anyone who wanted to, no more huge labels controlling creativity. Likewise Jamie Oliver. Yes I know Delia was the queen for years but she only had the housewife market. Jamie got blokes cooking, made it cool for us to get in the kitchen and make it our domain. That is how his genius killed off the packet food industry - i am a product of the CupaSoup generation. Finally Linus Torvalds - if anyone can claim credit for pissing on Bill Gates bonfire it has to be him.

Coming soon - the Second Coming - to a soul near you.

Here are snips of the three genii at work:
