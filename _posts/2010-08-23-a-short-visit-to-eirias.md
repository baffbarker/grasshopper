Right then,

Last week I was back in the UK for the first time in four years so did a lightning tour of all the old places I knew so well. One of them was  Eirias High School. A slightly less than happy experience apart from some teachers who did inspire me. My personal favourite was Mr Eric Mills whose lunch hour Astronomy Club was my favourite, and influenced me to this day. Before my daughter was born I purchased a Meade telescope and had a huge amount of fun with it exploring the hevens here in south Germany which thanks to the alps experiences the clearest skies I've ever had anywhere I've been in the world. All thanks to Mr Mills, of which the experience is outlined elsewhere in this blog under the tag "starhopping".

I have one regret now and that is not taking Mr Davy's German class that seriously.  He might be impressed now if he knew I am learning to it to University level! But I hated it at the time! Likewise my lousy turnout in PE was a surprise to Mr Kyffin years later when I told him I was in my 20s into rock climbing, paragliding and skiing. Some of us develop late!

I parked in the staff car park and went to the Front Office. It was of course closed for the summer but two nice ladies opened the door to chat a minute. One chap from the old days still there is Mr Spence who you may remember was our English teacher. He is still there as a counsellor. I liked him as he used to alllow us to read swear words in plays like Billy Liar!

So on to the photos. Here they are:
