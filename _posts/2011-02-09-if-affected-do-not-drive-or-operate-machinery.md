How often these words appear on packets of pills such as cold remedies! And yet having sat and absorbed that amazing article:

http://www.slate.com/id/2211257/entry/2211256/

and going theorugh this rite of passage as I am I now take on board this advice. Driving my son to kindergarden I am making driving decisions which I might not otherwise make, The same applies to going to the gym. What more dangerous heavy machinery is a weight bench!

Nope I shall busy myself with other tasks, like food shopping and reactivating my library membership, tasks which may not involve such intense mental faculties which presently are impaired.
