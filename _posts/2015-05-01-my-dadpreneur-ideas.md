Here is an overview of the creative ideas I've had lately:

1. Whilst skiing, measure my body angle during skiing black runs voice operated skiing app - record high density GPS points and body angle on voice command, using the accelerometer on the Galaxy

2. Write a detailed article on grief, loss for the New York Times expat page

3. Set up a website for expats faced with being in The Call Club - sponsored by airlines?

4. Write a cartoon animation storyboard -

-&gt; The Farting Princess
-&gt; The Peeing Frog
-&gt; The Burping Sheep

5. Write a book about the adventures of the Rev Frank Underwood - base jumper, thief, priest

6. Design a badge or brooch for grievers based on teardrop dove design

7. Dome - astronomy observatory - rollers problem solved Â - make it it of free cheap materials

8. Geodesic dome - global coordinate system and folding maps system

9. Build a huge globe using the Bucky Fuller globes. Land printed using Dymaxion projection

10. Design a system of weights to be sold mass market but uses only water - Waterweights!

11. Micronavigation is it possible to navigate on a micro scale using two wifi routers?? Similar to the old radar navigation systems see navigation using pencil and paper ebook
