<div>These are the things I wish I'd known when I was starting out along the path I'm on now.</div>
<div></div>
Dear Me in the future,
<div></div>
<div>As you hold that precious bundle in your arms right now, breathing its first breaths and marvel at the wonder of life you hold, there are a few things you may wish to understand over the next decade. Perspectives you may not yet hold but may help you in the extraordinary journey you are about to make. For as a man you are undertaking the role traditionally undertaken by women, yet you can bring so much to this role or task that whatever gender you are, of the two typical roles required by most households in the raising of a family. Whoever ends up "chained to the stove" so to speak, ends up in fact in the most important role of the whole enterprise. For if done right (which is a lofty ideal) that person male or female, can be the critical role to keep the whole ship on a steady course. You can be a gardener, a cook, a doctor, and a teacher all in one. (Why oh why did noone tell me this?)</div>
<div></div>
<div>First up build a veg garden. Plant some seeds in the spring, watch them come up and buy a copy of Jamie At Home- this book will start you off on the road to freedom. Additionally buy Omnivores Dilemma by Michael Pollan.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Buy a copy of Jamie's "Ministry of food" book to learn how to do basic cooking. One of the star recipes in the book is the curry chapter! Make those - vindaloo, korma, the lot! Make Sunday roasts. Then you will be able to start to understand food better. Plant salad crops in the garden and harvest them four months in summer,.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Buy a copy of James Wong's Grow your own drugs" and he shows where you can plant herbs and make salves and tinctures to heal small health crises.</div>
