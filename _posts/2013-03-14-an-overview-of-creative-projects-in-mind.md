I am creative. I write, take pictures, build the odd thing, yet I never ever seem to sit down, visualise the objective and carry it out. This thought came to me whilst in the sauna, and it struck me that even the act of writing this, as an <em>aide memoire</em> might help kick start me off making stuff again. So without further ado, let me list some of the projects I have in mind.

1. Building a garden chair for free out of wooden pallets as seen in the Instructables website.

2. Help my good friend Tracy Walker to develop a website about BASE jumping to teach newcomers about it. He has the content, I design the website.

3.  Write a novel/ short story about my "Wichea" and "Birds" concepts.

4. Put together a DJ set of dance tunes, maybe in Ableton, or my home DJ gear I found in Vivo.

5. Make a beautiful arty documentary based round the PDF "Splitting Firewood".

6. Mend the guitar I found in Vivo.

7. Build an ad hoc network between two WLANS and write about it. Research the "Freifunk" network.

8. Write a dance tune of my own.

9. Learn Blender 3d and make a piece inspired by "The Monolith" in 2001.

10. Go out with my telescope and make observations then make a decent drawing or photo of a planet.

11. Study the orbit of Venus whether it makes a 5 pointed pentagram as I read.

12. Shoot some film of local churches for Gae's music pieces.

13. Dig out my Saudi slide collection and scan the best ones and make a set of prints entitled "Secret Arabia".

14. Resurrect my stained glass hobby and build a third fish!

15. "Project Felix" - a balloon mapping project using a tetroon and a digital camera.

16. An Android app.

17. An Aquaponics system.

This is just a memory jogger, maybe a way of making me achieve these things. A lot of these will never be done! More ideas will be added to this blog as they occur to me.
