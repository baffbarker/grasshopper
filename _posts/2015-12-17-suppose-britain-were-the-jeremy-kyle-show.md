I was in my advanced German class Monday and the subject of a lie detector came up on the theme of "Kriminalit√§t" (the course material in my textbook is classical Cultural Marxism). The teacher explained what it was and I was about to humorously explain what that was to the class, an Iranian, some Russians, some Italians, a Czech. We have a TV show in Britain which noone admits to watching but everyone knows about.

A good look at this show serves as an analogy for what Britain has become. We all try to pretend it ain't so, but we all know people in our towns and cities who are like this. The JK show is like the Jeremy Springer roadshow - they trawl the pits of Britain hunting for the most vulnerable, poorly fed (blatantly obvious here from the obesity these poor people suffer) drunks and drug addicts.

But perhaps this is an analogy for what is happening in Britain as the whole nation comes to terms with what it is. The Jimmy Saville revelations (not all of the 600 allegations were what they seemed to be btw according to John Ward's "The Slog" and the Hackgate story show up our country for what it has become.

<strong><em>It is a bit like waking up after one of those awful parties and looking next to your pillow and finding a septum-damaged, alcoholic, tobacco stinky woman in a pile and thinking "What the fuck happened there?".</em></strong>
