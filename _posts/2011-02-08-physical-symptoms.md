I have read that auditory hallucinations are normal in extremis. I experienced this last week when I clearly heard my mother call me whilst lying in bed.

I'm presently suffering shortness of breath. Yesterday I suffered a strange wrist pain.

I do indeed get short chest pains. Another symptom I suffered the other day was tummy muscle cramp, like I'd done a load of sit-ups.
