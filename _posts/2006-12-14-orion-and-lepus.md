Tonight I hunted for the Crimson star R Leporis. I drew a skecth in the book to check up sometime. The asterism looked like an M or an upside down Cassiopeia.<br /><br />M79 - Gottim!<br /><br />Several Geminids seen.<br /><br />Tonight the transparency was very good. I couold see every star in the Little Bear.<br /><br />NGC 2017. Is this asterism shaped like a small Wild Duck Cluster?<br /><br />Orion<br /><br />Betelgeuse was abuttery yellow colour<br /><br />Rigel - I think I saw its blue companion.<br /><br />Then a slew to Heka at the head of Orion. I found Star D in Heka easier to resolve than star C as labelled in Clay Sherrod's tour of Orion. I couldnt find the B star.<br /><br />The evening ended with the naked eye clear view of Praesepe in Cancer.
