Yesterday I heard about an interesting Munich project called <a href="http://www.artchalking.org/modules.php?name=WLAN_Spots">Artchalking</a><br />which is a grassroots project to map wifi hotspots in Munich.

My interest in GIS has been rekindled by the website <a href="http://mappinghacks.com/">Mapping Hacks</a><br />a fascinating site which I cannot recommend highly enough. Short post today as we have childcare to return to!
