Right then,

This is my debut blog post. The preceding posts were just tests.

I have "blogged" for years. What I never liked was the standard formula you had to follow when writing, using one of "their" templates. I wanted my own way to code up my own HTML/CSS style sheet, so found this Jekyll tool very useful.

We'll be covering many topics, much of which will be around modern life and my humble efforts to make sense of it. I live in Bavaria, Germany and have the privilege of seeing a country reacting to globalization through the eyes of a foreigner. In my opinion, they are meeting the challenges of the modern world pretty competently. 

I describe myself as "awake" since about 2012. I'm quite versed in the agenda of the NWO and am attempting to concvince somewhat myopic Germans of its existence. Since last autumn I believe we've been subject to Operation Gladio. I'm a fan of David Icke yet see big holes in his thinking, but I love his writing. We owe him so much.

I rebooted my health about 18 months ago. Cut alcohol, sugar and reduced wheat (well reduced not cut sugar and wheat). Once I had my leptin under control, the alcohol was easy as pie. Food and nutrition play a huge part in my family life. I own a veg/fruit garden also.
