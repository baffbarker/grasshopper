<p>Well we have a thread which stzarted out jovially:</p><p>http://www.toytowngermany.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=314252&amp;st=0</p><p>under a pseudonym.</p><p>Now I have posted number 67 on that thread:</p><p>http://www.toytowngermany.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=314252&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=3160216</p><p>questioning the rules that allow different usernames. </p><p> </p><p>Indeed in the TT rules:</p><blockquote><p>The operation of two or more forum user IDs by one individual is strongly discouraged.<br /><br /> Occasionally a member may need a second ID in order to post something anonymously. This is permitted but only if there are reasonable grounds for doing so. For example, posting about a private medical problem, or making a complaint about an employer.<br /><br /> Duplicate IDs for the sake of posting a joke or a troll are not permitted.</p><p> </p></blockquote><p> </p>
