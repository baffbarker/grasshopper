Part of my digital music hobby involves learning as much as I can about...well all of it. One important section is to understand how synthesizers work. Thereare three elements to any synth:

1. The oscillator. May be eithe sine, sawtooth, block - all influence the kind ofÂ  sound.

2. The filter - most important element, it determines the shape of the out put sound

3. The amplifier - creates the "envelope" of the sound, how it is actually to reach the human ear.

All fascinating stuff.
