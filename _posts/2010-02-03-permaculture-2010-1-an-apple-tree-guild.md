Right this is the start of the 2010 permaculture season. The book by Toby Hemmenway is one of the most inspiring publications I've ever read, more than any conventional gardening course. This post will cover the first project.

According to principles of permaculture, one must develop "guilds" of connected plants to assist each other. Last autumn I planted daffodil bulbs around my apple tree as I read that the pests do not like these bulbs. I also dug up a root of comfrey (German <em>Beinwell</em>) from my allotment in the hope that it grows next year to build soils. Also, I dug in globe artichoke Â (<em>Cynara scolymus</em>) as I've read good stuff about their medicinal properties. Can it be perhaps that they not only have benefits for humans but also for plants?
