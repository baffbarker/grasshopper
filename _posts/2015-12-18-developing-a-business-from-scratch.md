Was thinking this morning of the direction I wish to take in the New Year. I've spent the last few months learning Java thanks to John Purcell's "<a href="http://courses.caveofprogramming.com/">Cave</a>" site and learnt so much. I wish to combine it with a new venture next year in the summer I think.

It strikes me that if you learn the following skills from scratch:
<ol>
	<li>How to set up a small business selling widgets</li>
	<li>How to undertake the graphical design of the site - look and feel</li>
	<li>How to write a basic HTML/CSS website to market those widgets</li>
	<li>How to string that together using Java/Spring/Servlets into a business site on its own not an "off the shelf" solution</li>
	<li>How to use SEO to market that product</li>
</ol>
....then you will have a very valuable set of skills to market to any future company.

To set up a business you need three things: a product, a market and a price. This summer an opportunity came to me which I did not take on. My reasons were basically that I didn't feel ready Â to undertake it as I didn't have the necessary skills to shift the product in a IT sense. I simply didn't feel ready. The market I'm thinking of is nice, will always exist for years, is relatively conservative and won't be a "get rich quick" scheme as I don't need that kind of stress.

According to Marx, the one who succeeds in business is the one who owns all means of production. (I'd add distribution to that but I may be wrong in my understanding of Marxian theory). The higher up the chain you go the more control you have over the means of production:
<ol>
	<li>Build a machine which makes the widgets</li>
	<li>Build a server on which the ecommerce solution rests</li>
</ol>
By these means you eventually own the market. That sounds like a sensible plan to me. Or am I, as I like to say, talking out of my bum?
