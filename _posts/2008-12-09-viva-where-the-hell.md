<p>This blog returned to life with interest in a Europe wide solar power project <a href="http://www.trecers.net/index.html">DESERTEC</a></p><p>Sounds ambitious and exciting. I think it is related to the <a href="http://www.mareinitiative.com/theprojet">MARE Initiative </a>which I think is more American in scope. </p><p>Then I got to ask myself: how might I be of service to such an initiative? After all I had many skills which might be applied: predominantly GIS development skills, language translation of technical German to English as I do that quite often for people I know already. I was also intrigued by the suggestion that desal water in the Sahara might enable the growing of crops. My <a href="http://www.theenglishgardener.blogspot.com/">horticultural knowledge</a> might also be handy after all!</p><p>A quick surfabout for any stuff which has been done regarding GIS for solar insolation found <a href="http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/apps3/pvest.php#">this</a> and <a href="http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/apps3/pvest.php#">this</a></p><p>This is what excited my interest.</p>
