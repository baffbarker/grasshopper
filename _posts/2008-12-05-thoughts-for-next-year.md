<p>A timetable for jobs for my own garden - only with regard to things like <em>succesional planting</em> of lettuces, which clut too much mid summer.</p><p>Encourage bees - watch flower coverage through year. Bees are critical to pollination of plants. The reason I am told we had a low plum harvest this year was that the bees didn't like the wet spring. The growing season started late this year.</p><p>Hot bed then experiment with it to  heat veg bed then winter garden</p><p>Forest garden - a la Robert Hart. I already have lots of hazel branch cuttings with which to start. Gooseberry bushes often appear in supermarkets.</p><p>Here is a list of plants for the Sonnenacker and veg bed I wish to try again:</p><p>Comfrey = Schwarzwurz {f} auf Deutsch. One of the most important to feed the plants. This year I will attempt to use no chemicals.</p><p>Spinach</p><p>Swiss chard (Mangold)</p><p>Cauliflower</p><p>Broccoli</p><p>Cabbage (not quite as much as this year)</p><p>Tomatoes</p><p>Paprika Peppers</p><p>Chili Peppers</p><p>Aubergines</p><p>Cucumbers</p><p>Different beans to this year - perhaps real beans you can harvest - possible chick peas?</p><p>Potatoes (baking, early)</p><p>Carrots,</p><p>Onions</p><p>Celery (the "Mirepoix" of cookery)</p><p>Sweetcorn (Golden Bantam)</p><p>Pumpkin</p><p>Beans (try three sisters again)</p>
