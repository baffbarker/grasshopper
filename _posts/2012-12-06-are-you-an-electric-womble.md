I have in my experience a 1 in 10 hit rate - meaning 9 out of 10 pieces of stuff I find will end up back in the bin, but the stuff which works is fantastic. I am very careful. I use thick gloves, I bring it home and wash the gear in the sink with hot water, then dry it a few days on top of my fireplace. I then Google the product name, download the PDF manual and we're in business.

This is an 8 in 1 card reader which enables me to read all my digital camera cards:

We have now free housewide Wifi thanks to the wonderful router I found. I believe there is a freeware firmware called DD-WRT or Tomato you can control your Wifi system with:

But what took this picture I hear you ask? Why none other than this beauty of a Canon Ixus 430. Sadly this model isn't hackable using CHSK. What's funny about this find was that I only had the camera the first day. I read up on google that it needed a special charger and went next day and rescued that too! :)
