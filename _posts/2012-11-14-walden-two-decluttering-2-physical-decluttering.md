I am a dreamer. Much of the rubbish I have collected over the years ghas been for future glory projects. A stack of old floorbaoards in the garage were intended for some "Instructable" type cool idea, or for some veg bed in which they'd have been hammered by the Bavarian winters, now I realise.

My worst department is the electrical stuff. I collected so much for future music or video projects which 
never happened. This kind of stuff was thrown out in seconds! 

The entertainment department received an inspection, with dozens of CDs never listened to chucked away. I wizzed through my vinyl album collection and must have chucked out a tenth. I did reserve two albums for mega-naffness sake. They were Gary Glitter and also a Cilla Black album!
