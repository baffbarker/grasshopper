<p class="western" align="left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Yesterday I undertook what has become a recent very healthy tradition in recent months for my wife and I, a short bike ride through the forest, to a very beautiful Baroque church deep in the Bavarian countryside here. The trip is not to short to gain a modicum of health to ensure sound sleep, yet not too long to take one away from family responsibilities. </span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Whilst there, I sat and briefly contemplated the Void, lit a candle for my parents and recharged somewhat. It's kind of led to today's missive, namely, what happened to the tiny island I grew up on? It was an awesome place, yes slightly rainy I admit, but with a decent good humoured folk who extracted their own coal and iron ore and built ye a quarter of the planet in its heyday. The British Empire practically ruled the planet. Our ships were the best of the seas largely because we are in island so had to build good ones to survive the cruel waves. We discovered most of the world ïn the name of the King¨. Not all sunshine and smiles though. We built guns, sailed to West Africa swapped them fr slaves then sailed across to the West indies then swapped those poor souls fr sugar then sailed back to Britain. The dark pain experienced by hose poor benighted souls can only begin to be comprehended when it is estimated somewhere that half of those slaves died on the crossing. The dark legacy is also evident to this day when we contemplate the commodity traded which has aid waste to our Empire's subject, namely sugar. Our coalfields attracted the poor who had to live in red brick terraces one after the other n foul conditions. All the while we believed in ¨Britain¨ whatever that was. </span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">One thing which strikes me as true about Britain is that we have constantly been at war over the last century. The Crimean War, the Boer War, the first World War, The Second World war, The war against Northern Ireland, the First Gulf War, the Second Gulf war against Afghanistan and Iraq, then our later years role as tiny us aircraft carrier for failed missions to bomb brown children. Why oh why can#t we ¨Bring the Boys Back Home¨ as Roger Waters sang? Cant we raise our children on a healthy diet free of bloodshed and instead some hope for a nicer existence than what we have made? </span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">In another post soon I'm going to turn many of the sacred ¨truths¨ we've held as important on their heads. With the writings of the recently late Dave McGowan i'm going to ask what the hell happened during the yeah-man-cool 1960s and whether everything that happened was so fab man, given the deaths of so many to drugs and alcohol. I'm also going to take a rest from pissing on the grave of Margaret Thatcher, to ask whether everything she tried to be about was so bad and how much she actually was permitted to do until she no longer served her even higher up masters in the -city who hold the real power. Yes with the 2012 year things started to go really topsy turvy ad revelations came out about our past which weren't so easy to stomach but reckon with the bare truth of why certain recent events occurred in British history of which we were - no to say blissfully rather drugfully - unaware.</span></span></p>
