Dear Jeremy:
 
Thanks for the message. I talked with XXXXXX today and he
seemed optimistic over the possibility of you joining us
sometime this spring. You inquired about field work: We
have an array of tasks requiring field data collections
such as sediment samples for hydrocarbon and metal content,
deployment of thermographs and current meters, monitoring of
coral reefs and fishes, transplantation of mangroves, plankton
collection, intertidal and subtidal benthos collection and
sorting and drilling platform studies. Since I've had a
hand in all of these types of tasks in one way or another,
I oversee the data collections and coordinate with various
task leaders regarding necessary logistics, personnel or any
equipment problems one may encounter. Aside from that I have
also been asked to run the biotope mapping program. Since
we are very thin on manpower, I am doing the field sampling,
which consists of diving approximately every 1-2 kilometers
along the coastline up to a contour of 10 meters depth. I
determine the bottom type (deep sediment, flat rock, coral reef,
seagrass, mud etc.) and record the major organisms associated
with each area along with the position using a GPS. Back in
the office I have been plotting the positions onto a base
map using Intergraph. I plot a section of the coastline
and then hand draw the biotope map based on field observations
and aerial photographs. Fortunately, I am slightly ahead of
schedule and hope to have all maps drawn by the middle of
February. I will then enter all of the station data into
an Excel file to give the client a semi-quantitative insight
to a given area. The data collected would be ideal for a
GIS however, as mentioned before, I just don't have support
for such an undertaking. With your arrival, at least we
can share ideas. I have only just started getting aquainted
with Intergraph and perhaps after the maps are drawn and
data recorded, I can begin to attemp the digitizing process
until you arrive. Feel free to inquire about anything here;
the work, lifestyle, etc.

Jeremy:  Many questions; I'll try and address some of them
for you.  First of all, come with very little expectations.
This place is only tolerable if you are very self-motivated.
It can be very boring if you are waiting for something to
happen. The cultural experience is great for a couple of
years especially if you come with an open mind. Now for
some specifics:  UNIX - I am checking on that for you. I
know Yusef (one of our colleagues) used UNIX exclusively
while at school in the States but I don't know what the
status is here. GRASS - I used to work for the US Army
Corps of Engineers and I believe GRASS was developed by
them. I would like to learn more about this application,
especially if the software is available for a PC. SOCIAL LIFE -
Not much, although once you start meeting people there is
a lot going on; but most of the exciting activities are not
found at KFUPM. The hardest part is your initial arrival
because you don't have transportation, and there aren't many
people to lean on to show you around. The quicker you meet
people the faster your social options will develop. Don't
worry, we'll take you under our wing but you'll soon get
tired of a family of three little kids. You will need a
television and VCR but you'll need a multisystem that plays
Pal-Secum and NTSC 3.58 (American System). TVs are not
expensive but VCR's are. There are frequently used models
available for sale. CLIMBING - This is the desert. Not many
hills much less mountains around here. There are however,
jebels which is the arabic word for hills, very close to
us. These are rock/sand hills that are similar to pinnacles
reaching up to a hundred feet or so. Great for watching
sunsets and getting some exercise. There are some large
sand dunes that offer the same. During the holidays you
may want to travel to the SW portion of the Kingdom where
there are mountains. We'll breif you more on that when you
get here. PARAGLIDERS or hang-gliders - I haven't seen any.
Your best bet is to get you interested in the water; some
decent reefs for skin or SCUBA diving and great winds and
warm water eight months of the year for windsurfing.  TOWNS -
There is a large town ten minutes from the University. It
is a mix of older arab style and newer western type shops. In
the past 5 to 8 years there has been an increase in diversified
merchandise; just about anything you need is available. It is
easy to get a ride into town with friends, buses or taxis.
A TYPICAL DAY AT KFUPM - This is from a family man's perspective:
Work starts at 7:30 am. The days go fast. There is very little
to no pressure at work mainly because deadlines are not a daily
or weekly concern. Project reports are usually quarterly or annually.
Once you know your assignments you are left alone to do your job,
which I really enjoy and appreciate. For lunch, you can go the
the Recreation Center that has a snack bar or the University
cafeteria. A couple of us go to the rec center, swim a few laps
in the pool and then have a quick lunch. Evenings for me are
spent frequently with my kids. I also try to do something active
like play tennis, basketball or jog. I also play organised baseball
and coach a ladies team. Video movies are a popular way of wasting
an evening and weekends are usually time for small social gatherings.
The University has it's own beach facilities - approximately 40
minutes driving time. There is a small social sailing club that
has access to windsurfers, sunfishes and laser sailboats. So that's
about it in a nutshell. Keep in mind that I came over here as a
bachelor, and met my wife to be six months later. More later, XXXX
