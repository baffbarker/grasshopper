I've stumbled upon <a href="http://100milediet.org/">this site </a> and found it inspiring, yet daunting. I think the ability to "go local" depends really upon the region, for example if one lives near the sea one can purchase fantastic seafood, yet landlubbers might take more advantage of the larder in the mountains, as we have near the Alps.

Some of the staples which may need to be replaced:

<strong>Sugar</strong> - have to be replaced by honey - we obtain all of that locally anyway. There is such a thing as sugar beet, and in the Rhineland there is sold a product "Zuckerrüben-Sirup". Hey is that molasses? Can that be used instead of malt to brew beer? Typical bloke way of thinking huh?

<strong>Cornflakes</strong> - can this be replaced by local porridge? 

<strong>Milk</strong> - One great new recent development is that Bavarian produced milk is now available in the Lidl supermarket chain. A glance at the label could even show the dairy which produced the milk.

<strong>Salt</strong> - Local tourist salt mines for preserving at Bad Reichenall.

<strong>Beer</strong> - Given that we live in one of the world's capitals for brewing, local breweries can help in this regard!

<strong>Wine</strong> - the possibility exists to drink wine off my own grapevine. I've fermented them the last two years and they supply about ten litres of wine a year. Also wines from Südtirol vineyards could be bought.

Olive oil - to come from N. Italy? This is an interesting question. do olive trees grow in northern Italy, the limit for our area? (or do we have to cheat to include those Italian goodies? Perhaps make the circle an oval with say food coming from 150 miles south and 50 miles north? The average travel distance may be the same.

A map of the area would be interesting - showing soil, veg, climate - the whole geography of food would need to be considered. Additionally, the environmental impact of differing cuisines - Italian for us is low impact, Indian high owing to spices. But then, the tomatoes are from Italy, yet the spices are light to transport, so the question as to which is greener is not that easy. Another question: must it be 100 miles? Bavaria only? Italy? E Europe? Must it be  a circle? An equidistant circle may preclude whole gastronomic regions.
