Whilst surfing around the theme Permaculture I found a fascinating off print regarding organic gardening on the Spiral Seed website:<br /><br />http://www.spiralseed.co.uk/dfr/ Dig for Revolution.<br /><br />It contains stuff which I already knew but the last bit is interesting as I wasn't aware about the issue of seed patenting. Read this:<br /><br />http://www.cuts-international.org/pdf/CIA23-April-June.pdf<br /><br />and this:<br /><br />http://www.radiomundoreal.fm/rmr/?q=en/node/25429<br /><br />When I buy my seeds from the supermarket in spring I'm going to have to check not only the species name but the variety name.<br /><br />It gives me a new impetus towards seed saving which I wasn't aware of, an important part of permaculture.
