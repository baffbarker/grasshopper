<p>Right then,</p><p>Here is a snippet of advice from one who has just learned his mistake. I am presently digitizing our town for Openstreetmap as I believe in the community effort to build a map of where we live. </p><p>I've been entering JOSM then using Nominatim to select the town in which I live - "Holzkirchen" in southern Germany. Unnoticed by me, there are two "definitions" of the place. The first is a relatively narrow small area defines as a "town" which I'd been clicking on often. The second is as (I think) a region. I'd been clicking on the former and downloading OSM data for that alone.</p><p>Now I didn't realise my error till I received a rightly disgruntled message from one who had been far more hard working than I in the same area. Upon checking the data in JOSM I saw that he was absolutely right. My error was to capture over an area Nominatim had selected which was too narrow.</p><p>I thus duly deleted all my bad capturing, which was doubly captured house outlines and apologised to him! </p><p>I hope that makes sense. </p>
