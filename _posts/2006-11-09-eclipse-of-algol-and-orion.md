Betelgeuse yellow star. Rigel seen white.<br /><br />Mintaka - beautiful double primary is yellow green and secondary is blue green.<br /><br />Mair al Saiph - beautiful open cluster.<br /><br />M42 - I saw the Trapezium for the first time. Last time it seemed hidden behind the bright single star. Nebula structure no so clear tonight.<br /><br />NGC 1981 - interesting formation.<br /><br />Tonight I was ablke to identify for the first time the constellations of Aries and Cetus. My sketches in my notebook indicate this.<br /><br />But I think most exciting for me tonight was the first proper experience of an eclipse of Algol. A very definite dip in magnitude was seen.
