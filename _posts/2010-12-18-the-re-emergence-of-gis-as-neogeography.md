I've been involved in geographic information systems since about 1988, when I first saw the Edinburgh University GIMMS package drawing maps on a huge Tektronix monitor plotting on a n equally large Calcomp plotter.

For me personally, over the years the promise of the early GIS seemed to wane as these systems were undeniably expensive, and became the subject of bitter turf wars as people fought over possession of data, software and hardware to prove their virtuosity in GI. 

All that has thankfully come of age with the advent of cheap GPS, Web 2.0 technologies and the rise since 2004 of VGI or Openstreetmap. It is with great excitement that my new mobile phone which has GPS, that I return to the subject which I learned all those years ago, but with new eyes. I just managed to find a classic paper by "God" in GIS, Professor Goodchild. It's his endorsement which is prompting me to return to this nascent field. Here is his classic paper:
