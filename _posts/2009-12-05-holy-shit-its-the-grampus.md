For those not in Germany, or not in the Alps region for that matter, today is the German tradition of Nikolaus. If like me you think it's just traipsing to Aldi for one of those tummy ache inducing chocky Santa things, you're incorrect. For in rural Bavaria it's a Catholic spectacle not to be missed. The brother of our neighbour does it. We arranged an appointment for him to come, yet the preparations were a little elaborate. I was briefed to dash to the supermarket and buy some tangerines, one choc Santa each and one toy. Most importantly we had to write a note by the door with each child's name, and one good and one bad point about each one....

We had a visit from the inlaws also so having lit the tile stove to warm us up, I lit loads of candles around the room to give the right winter atmosphere. The Germans are crazy with candlelight at this time of year.

Suddenly the doorbell went. In came what looked like The Pope himself, resplendent in red, with a long staff which he banged on the tiled floor as he walked. he had a fantastic long beard which could've done with a trim, and on his red cloak was a gold cross.

But behind him came one of the scariest creatures I've ever seen, the Grampus! He was dressed in black, with a crude rope round his waist, carried a chain which rattled and a broom which he used to whack naughty children (allegedly). Tall bugger, he looked like he'd stepped out of an Alice Cooper or Led Zeppelin video.

Nikolaus stood in our tile stove room and opened his gold book, he read a poem, then beat the floor with his staff, then proceeded to discuss how well behaved of bad the children had been this year. How he know all this the children couldn't figure out! My son stepped forward to shake his hand. Absolutely brave, she stared at them both yet showed no fear. I admired him. Daughter however was a nervous wreck. She sat by Opa hardly daring to move, yet I held her and she thus shook his hand later. Daughter was praised for thinking always of others first, but told not to watch so much telly! Son was praised for being hard working and brave, yet didn't brush his teeth often enough.

Then the sack was produced and out came the presents. Both were excited, yet after they had left my daughter was watching to he door in case he came back. On their way out we donated a little something to the church for their good causes.

All in all one of the most impressive German traditions I've ever seen. The Grampus scared the hell out of me, I was almost going to promise to drink less beer next year!

Almost.

Upon relating the story a few days later to people in Munich, I was told that there was no Grampus visiting the kids there, only the Nikolaus. I started to ask myself questions...

I'm starting to think about why the Grampus tradition has survived in the mountain regions and not the plains - the lowlands which aren't the alps. One reason may lie in the approach to mythology as discussed by Joseph Campbell. is it possible that the Grampus reflects a dualistic vision of good and evil, where both are acknowledged as existing, whereas in the Christian/Catholic view there is only the "good" Nikolaus" acknowledged to exist. Can it be that the dualist image I saw represents some kind of hang-back to the mountain folk's sort of appreciation of the male/female balance whereas the plains one view only is a patriarchal vision of male superiority?

It was starting to read about Joseph Campbell which spurred on this above thinking.

Here are some pictures of the dynamic duo:

....and here's a shot of the evil incarnate himself...
