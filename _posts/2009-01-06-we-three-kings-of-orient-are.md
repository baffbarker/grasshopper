...one in a taxi one in a car.<br /><br />January 6th is IIRC Twelfth Night and here in Germany called Drei KÃ¶nigen. What is especially nice about living in Germany is the respect they have for their traditions which we in Britain seem to have lost since corporations came to rule our lives.<br /><br />I'd told my daughter the day before about thie tradition that three "kings" would come to the door and ask  for alms. All day we waited - it was a Bavarian holiday (they're always on holiday here) and waited. As dusk fell it semed they weren'T going to come and my little girl began to cry as she was so eager to see this happen. Then ding dong went the doorbell and there appeared three kids in the freezing cold. They each recited a poem asnd asked for money for the church. Our local Catholic Church, in spite of what I've read in "Holy Blood Holy Grail" does quite a lot of good for charity and ours sends the money to Argentina. One of them had a blacked out face which (when time allows I'll research that and enter it here)symbolised one of the wise men.<br /><br />After we'd given them money - we were so impressed that they stood out in the freezing temperatures that we gave a lot - they wrote on our door the following:<br /><br />20 * C + M + B * 09.<br /><br />This means 2009 split into two and the initial letters of the three kings (look up. Balthasar is one them.
