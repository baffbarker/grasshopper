Well I have been unbelievably crippled by a bad head cold which left me laid out literally, sprawled on the couch watching "A Place In The Sun". The odd thing is that my brain has somehow woken up, the synapses have begun melding with each other and I have come out with brand new concepts and ideas which I am desperate to start:
<ul>
	<li>paradesic satellite dishes. What are they? Gonna build one and show you!</li>
	<li>tetrapak window farms - the wife wants a daily salad in a jam jar.- This is the way to grow them.</li>
	<li>growing mushrooms on coffee grounds - build a business based on this.</li>
	<li>strong plastic sheeting for greenhouses using an iron.</li>
	<li>a lawn care business. That I already do but on steroids. There is an army of these guys in the States doing this.</li>
	<li>an LED powered "laser" organ using Java multithreading on a Raspberry Pi</li>
	<li>a geodesic garden astronomy observatory</li>
	<li>a "flying toaster" high altitude balloon mission</li>
</ul>
The cool thing is these projects if I do them correctly won't cost much at all.

Now if anyone reads this they're gonna think i am nuts, but these madcap projects utilise practically free waste which pass through my fingertips every week. As a daily practising Qi Gong-er there is something very very Taoist about how these ideas floated into my head, especially after a pretty lousy few weeks of being ill.
