Right Â then,

Ba 2045 mankind will have sat back older and wiser, and much much sadder. For he will have come to realize that since this century began millions have died either through war, poverty, ignorance, or just plain evil. He will have come to understand some of the reasons why a load of the entirely confusing things have happened since it began which weren't so obvious at the time as he was plugged into a kind of Ickeian hologram. It was only when the new Gutenberg press (this newfangled Internet) rose to prominence and people started thinking for themselves that the walls surrounding the Shitadel fell.

I think four aspects of life will come to be understood to be no more true than belief in witchcraft in the 1600s. Why do I choose witchcraft? Because that is the era of insanity chosen by Michael "Jurassic Park" Crichton in his mind blowing State of Fear book:
<ol>
	<li>The Bollocksian belief that a carbohydrate-heavy diet - pasta, bread, sugar are healthy for you</li>
	<li>The Bollocksian belief that man actually causes climate change</li>
	<li>The Bollocksian belief in Peak Oil</li>
	<li>The Bollocksian belief that the present education system is somehow good for you.</li>
</ol>
Only then when these four bollocksisms are laid to rest will the truth set us free.
