Following the<strong> Orion</strong> Clay Sherrod Tour<br /><br />Mintaka - double star at 1 o clock. Seeing was poor. Comparison star came into view then disappeared.<br /><br />Eta Orionis - at high mgnification I think I split them. I'd say they were about an angle between 2 and 3 o clock - approx 80 degrees.<br /><br />Betelgeuse was a beautiful orange colour tonight<br /><br />Heka - drawn in my notebook as brightest at bottom, then 3rd above then 2nd at top. Generally beautiful star field. Must return to this.<br /><br />NGC 2168/2194 - a gem! Sketched star layout in notebook.<br /><br />NGC 2186 - not too amazing<br /><br />M76 - sketched. Nice object with two stars in middle.<br /><br />M42 - beautiful. Deserves one night alone to study.<br /><br />23 Orionis - nice double.<br /><br />Sigma Orionis - see sketch.<br /><br /><strong><br />Taurus</strong><br /><br />M1 - Crab Neb - a BFT.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Perseus<br /><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Atiks - Is the "B" star at 6 o clock beneath?<br /><br />M34 - nice but not amazing<br /><br />Tour ended with sight of Saturn in Leo and a meteor in Casseiopeia.
