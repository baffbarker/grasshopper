Dug out a recipe from my mate's veg book on Fritatta. In it went home grown pumpkin from the Sonnenacker, marjoram from the herb bed and free range eggs bought from the next village. The stock was simply potato water which I make a habit of keeping in the fridge often now.<br /><br />What I like to do with new recipes is check out "Fritatta" on wiki for the basic principle of the recipe - in this case an omelette mixed in with veg, which means I can in future when stuck for ideas create my own. For example I know broccoli/cauliflower and cheese like each other so there's a new recipe before we've even started.
