Well down at the "weed acker" stuff is growing like mad. I harvested yesterday about 600g both of mane tout and normal peas. I had no time to stake them up this year, but they cropped okay. Fennel bulbs and kohl rabi are doing well. I picked a load of swiss chard which is rapidly becoming a favoiurite veg since you can fry it in garlic, olive oil then mix in mushrooms and dump it on a pizza. This is in fact what I did. However since I made those swiss card pasies my interest in shortcrust pastry has increased, especially since we have millions of apples lying around. Perhaps even a bash at some wine for cooking. The plums on my trees make excellent sherry for Chinese dishes.<br /><br />Finally lugged out of the car the freezer sis in law gave us - we need to stroe our harvests as they are coming in thick and fast. <br /><br />Spoke to several locals who all say the tomato harvest is very late this year owing to the rains. Some of mine don't even have flowers. So it goes. Hoping for enough later to make my fave chicken cacchiatori (speling?) <br /><br />Well now we are off to weed the plot before the sun gets to hot!
