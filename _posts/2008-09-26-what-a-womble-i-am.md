Trip to Baywa builders merchants for supplies for our cellar projecxt were an excuse to visit Vivo. Not much today just a plug cable extender and some funny projector thingy. <br /><br />On the way back a rather embarrassing cock up which I put down to language difficulties. I had asked at the Italian we frequent for old wine boxes, picturing vintage wooden boxes on my terrace next summer. However the man brought out a load of flattened cardboard boxes with a daft look on his face and I realise we had a miscommunication. His younger chef fetched wooden ones when I told him in German they weren't quite right but they were awful looking things!<br /><br />What a Womble!
