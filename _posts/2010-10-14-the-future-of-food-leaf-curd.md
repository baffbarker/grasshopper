Where will we be when the oil runs out? For an omnivore there may be farms supplying home slaughtered meat which will enjoy a revival, yet this may not supply all of our needs. The options are to vegetarian, and some do this even though they eat meat, as they eat compassionately, meaning they respect the source of their meat and try to both use every part of the animal yet prefer when quality meat is unavailable to eat vegetarian.

Now the problenm when one eats vegetarian is that much of the diet involves pulses. Many of these pulses come from long distances, so when fuel prices riose so surely will the price of these necessities.

So the obvious chioice is to include leaf curd in the diet. Â This as yet for me is a completely uneyplored territory, yet I believe it must be the future for food. Here is a site which explores the subject in greater detail:
