Well I have been immersed almost two thirds of a year in learning to "code". It sort of happened around my "health reboot" and the discovery of the wonderful site Cave of Programming run by a fantastic British man John who wrote wonderfully-gentle-on-this-older-mind small ten minute bite sized tutorials. I began at the beginning with Java from scratch, spent quite some time getting my head round newer concepts in object oriented software design. I'm an old FORTRAN and legacy type of IT man, everything I learned was procedure based very top down in style. Actually thinking back, it was highly inflexible and didn't account for any kind of changes in the development of a project. Fast forward to now and where am I? I've dutifully followed all the stuff on Android app development, Java even design patterns such as MVC (that took ages to grasp) then as I wished to gain an insight into both aspects of coding front-end and back-end, I also learned Servlets and JSPs. It was then I realised - humbling myself is a common experience of being older - that I didn't even have a webpage nor a site of my own. I had no idea what to do, how to develop a basic HTML site with CSS. The web I knew in the 1990s was written in MS Frontpage and used to have hideous bouncy rugby ball icons. Now today we have a mature web and I wish to learn how to code properly. I have to start from the beginning. So here is an outline of walking, running and flying:

<strong>Walk: </strong>develop basic nice <em>static</em> sites in HTML/CSS. Teach yourself the principles of good design

<strong>Run</strong>: deploy the object oriented knowledge gained from Java/JSP to develop <em>dynamic</em> sites.

<strong>Fly</strong>: Leverage the JSP, Java classes into coherent code systems by wiring together in the Spring Framework.

So, I'm at the walk stage. As is usual in my case, I make it all too complex! It is my intention to develop a really nice website for a person.

To that end, lately I found through the miracle of the Net a lady in Florida who needs my help. It is this which I am going to utilise to launch a future career as a web designer and programmer. i shall be blogging about this process of design in due course.
