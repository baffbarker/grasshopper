...and its fleece was white as snow...<br />...except where it peed all over the place!<br /><br />Yesterday I took delivery of three "ster" of beech wood for our tile stove. It was delivered ona tractor trailer in front of the garege so I had to move sharp to gat it all stacked up in front of the east side of the house.<br /><br />Today whilst paying for our firewood at a nearby <span style="font-style:italic;">Bauernhof</span> or farmhouse, I heard a scuppering sound up the stairs. Thinking it was a dog my eyes took a double take and realised it was a lamb. A small firl carried it back downstairs and it ran around the hall. I noticed it had what looked like a bandage round its waist but the lady explained it was a nappy. The lamb was just threee days old and its mother had died, so they had to bottle feed it like a human baby. As it was a boy lamb it would <span style="font-style:italic;">pinkel</span> all over the floor so thus the nappy was deployed. One of the stranger sights which make Bavarian rural life never dull.
