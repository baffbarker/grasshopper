Or was it crying?

Reading Nigel Slater's wonderful evocative memoir of the 60s and 70s, "Toast" brought up a treasury of memories. Many of them resurfaced in my recent visit to Britain, after too long abroad here in Germany as an expat. Much of the time was spent visiting places special to our family, first to my Mum and afterwards to me as a child. I've begun to reflect on things recently when my parents were back here in Germany and discovered a huge central truth about myself which has governed almost all of my longings and desires and driven me crazy with homesickness in the last few years. There is a word in German called "Heimweh" and a Welsh word "Hiraeth" which somehow encapsulate this feeling. The problem is the hunger manifests itself in so many ways deeply buried in the subvconscious, and the devastating reality is that a visit back to the source doesn't actually satiate that need. To paraphrase that line in "Apocalypse Now". "Trouble was, I'd been there [home] and it just didn't exist for me anymore".

I grew up in a wonderfully free place between the mountains and the sea, in a small Welsh seaside town a friend once said had a "decayed beauty" to it. I ran like a feral animal around the long garden, its attached field and nearby trees were the background to my advantures, real and imagined. There were dens galore to build, when my father scythed the grass with his fantastic easy movement we'd build nests and holes everywhere in his wake, my Dad would plant tomatoes in an old Wolseley, potatoes in a trench, we had a mint bed, manure heap, apples, pears - all the idyllic trappings of a young beginning. The sea wasa few hundred yards away, rock pools were explored, my mother took me down often to the beach to play sandcastles and in late summer huge shoals of mackerel would boil up on the sea surface, asa armies of locals would cast and spin to haul in their freezer filling loads. Beghind us lay the mountains which were feared, a vast wilderness of the Carneddau where one had to tread carefully or one might die.

All this wild world ended abruptly in the late 1970s, when we moved away to a bigger town, also in the country, yet to unfamiliar accents, attitudes, and ways of thinking. _My old town was just seven miles away, yet the old village upbringing must have influenced me deeply in ways I am only understanding, as it was an ex-"chapel" village" where the old stern way of lecturing in mornin prayers contrasted with the dormoitory village mentailty of commuters to the newer place. I never ever recovered from that trauma and I outline small ways now as evidemce opf that...

Gardening - to me learning all about growing food is a way back to the safe place of my early youth, the smell of tomato plants growing in Wolseleys and a gentler way of life.

Caravanning - we spent eveery summer somewhere in our Sprite Major caravan and how cosy it felt then to be away from it all, playing Scrabble by lamps fired with gas, thos eold mantles which kept breaking!

Music - my brother first played me Genesis "I know what I like" and to my very young ears its tune would resonate, and lead me down a path to explore music of the 60s and 70s, raiding my borhtrs album collections and put my musical tates at least 20 years behind my contemporary "punk" schoolmates.

Railways - the site this afternoon of a train awakened a little boy's excitement at trainspotting and model railways, first awakened when entering a room of our house whiere my oldest brother had set up a fantastic Triang (pre-Hornby) train set.

To be spell checked and continied...
