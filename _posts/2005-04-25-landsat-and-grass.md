Today I solved the GRASS install problem. You need to specify the URL of the "geni" GRASS site, and add it to the list of FTP sites to download Cygwin and GRASS together. How it has changed since I used to download the software!<br /><br />Landsat imagery for 1999 are now downloaded for bands 245 and reside on my home PC ready for use.<br /><br />Emails about European roads gave the response that I should go to VMAP0 for this data set. May be okay for the Autobahns.<br /><br />Last minute poking about brought up German States as E00 fotrmat data under opengeodb, along with the PLZ its very useful.
