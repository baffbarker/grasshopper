Saw the two stars of Draco for the first time near to Lyra. Now I can spot that one.<br /><br />Highlight of the night has to have been seeing the Apenning mountain chain like a wheel spoke out of the Sea of Serenity. On its edge were the crater Archimedes and at the top at 12 o'clock, the large crater Aristotle and the smaller Eudoxus.
