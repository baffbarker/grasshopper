I've found the economic meltdown for some reason fascinating since it brought up the name of one of the past masters of economics who has been a dirty word for too long - John Maynard Keynes - and resurrected him to his rightful place in current thinking. For decades since Thatcher and Reagan the thinking of Milton Friedman has dominated economics and his laissez faire approach relaxed approach to the markets has now been seen to have been a false philosophy. <br /><br />I studied A level economics and was reasonably good at it, but chose the geography path instead. Hence my current resurgance of interest. was surfin' about  recently when I came across this <a href="http://www.mcafee.cc/Introecon/IEA.pdf">fine free ebook</a> for those who may be interested.<br /><br />For those who don't know the blogger of the moment is Robert Peston who always seems to have the scoop on what is happening in the British economy. I've added his link to the right.
