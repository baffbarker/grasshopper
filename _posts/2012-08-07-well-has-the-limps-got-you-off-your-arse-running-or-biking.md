It has with me. 

as this blog testifies, I was always a keen mountain biker on forest trails, but this morning I lugged my carcass outa bed and ran 3.5k. Given it's school hols and I have to fit it in before wife goes off to work, this actual act was for me an achievement. I ran slowly, felt slight pain in my legs but simply stopped and walked when it got too much. I'm going to try to fit into the "Couch to 5k" thing but it isn't easy. most likely my motivation will die within days or weeks, but I'm at least out there.

I want the tummy of Jessica Ennis. On second thoughts, sod running, just let me grab her waist!
