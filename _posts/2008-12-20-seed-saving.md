<p>I've been a subscriber to <a href="http://www.kitchengardeners.org/">Kitchen Gardeners International</a> for a while now. Their "Eat The View" campaign to get Americans gardening by the example of the White House lawn being turned over to a "Victory Garden" is gathering speed which is encouraging. </p><p>From their forums (or is it fora?) I cam across this <a href="http://www.nativeseeds.org/how_to/seedsave">very informative page</a> about seed saving which I need to absorb later in the next season. Seeds can be expensive, or at least good seeds, not the cheap packets in supermarkets. I think this craft will grow, certainly I wish to get more into it, then your garden becomes truly self sustaining if you save your own every year.</p>
