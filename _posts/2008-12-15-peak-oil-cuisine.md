<p>All very well telling us to get an allotment, plant apple trees and all that, but has anyone actually thought about the items we use to cook which aren't from our allotments and gardens? For example, if the supermarket chains collapse and we are reduced to foraging, from where exactly is our olive oil going to come from? That Britain imports nost of its foods is well known, (not sure of the percentage in Germany) but from where might for example our cooking oils hail? </p><p>Take olive oil. I cook a load with this stuff. We may have to find alternatives to this. Given that in Italy there have been <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12571726">cases</a> of adulteration of olive oil with hazelnet oil, why not thus grow more hazels locally and grind these into oil? We could then have an excuse to plant more <a href="http://www.allotmentforestry.com/">hazels</a> in our gardens.</p><p>Where is our milk and cheese going to come from? We already occasionally obtain raw milk from the nearby farm but I can foresee a time when that might be a necessity, and we may need to learn how to make cheese and butter from this product. ourselves. From where are the bakeries going to obtain their flour? All that will have to change. </p><p>It will be goodbye to Oriental food as those lovely ingredients become scarcer, unless they are grown locally. Last night on River Cottage HFW visited Birmingham where Jamaicans grow their favourite greens on their allotment whcih he had never heard of. A whole food culture will have to readapt to a post oil era.</p>
