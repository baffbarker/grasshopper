Mars seen quite large in telescope but no detail visible. Hopefully a Barlow might help that if I had one.<br /><br />As Moore said the most interesting aspect of moon observing is noting where the Terminator shows up new features. Tonight at midnight Mare Crisium was the big feature, a deep dark "sea". It resides right above the Sea of Fetility, the Sea of Trnquility (my fave name!), and the Sea of Serenity. Above that were seen the craters Cleomedes, Endymion, Atlas and Hercules, two smaller craters below Endymion. The Tycho rays were bright tonight.
