The week stuttered and started into life. Little Boy started kindergarten and apart from a few tears the pretty young assistant teacher said he has been relatively easy in his first week, apart from me leaving him crying in the lady's arms which yesterday gave me a huge guilty conscience and sent me down for the whole day. <br /><br />Life alone takes getting used to. Either you have loads of energy or you dopn't, especially if one of them kicks you awake in the night. Yesterday was such a day of low energy.<br /><br />Today I attempted to get back to fitness with a return to the cross trainer and 25 good minutes on what I think is called interval training where the hill is climbed in short bursts. My heart rate went above 80 which was within my "training zone". Funnily enough I have discovered when you dream on the cross trainer you are in say a gym and there's a bronzed gorgeous tight boobed one next to you, your heart rate drops. Now why the hell is that so?
