Saw on the BBC Breakfast yesterday that the Min of Education or whatever they are called is trying to get British kids to do some PE.They said motivating them is not easy.<br /><br />Well my daughter has been doing "<span style="font-style:italic;">Tournen</span>" for ages in her kindergarten now and loves it. <br /><br />Soon when the daylight allows and there is no more ice on the roads I want to start jogging again. It fits in with my plan:<br /><br />1. Grow as much of my own food as I can<br />2. Learn to cook it in interesting ways<br />3. Then hopefully run off oall the fat I have put on.<br /><br />Part 1 had limited success last year owing to my beginner status. Part 2 is undetgoing a hiatus until the new kitchzen is installed - we are living on old bits of thrown away carpet at the moment till the old kitchen is pulled down. Part 3 has been dead in the water. I bought this cross trainer which has never been used much and lies in my cellar. Hope to start the running thing soon.
