<strong>Cassiopeia</strong><br /><br />I learned the names of some of the stars such as Shedir, Caph and Ruchbah.<br /><br />M52 - pretty cluster with one bright star<br /><br />M103 - 2 groups of stars seen. Left one remids me of Wild Duck Cluster<br /><br />NGC 7759 - too open a cluster for the ETX.<br /><br />NGC 103 - nice wide area bigger than 40mm SP eyepiece. Approx 3 times that area in size.<br /><br />IC 1805 - nice but loose cluster.<br /><br />Bubble Nebula - no I didnt see it.<br /><br />NGC 457 - beautiful, the two brightest stars do look like the eyes of an owl!<br /><br />Zeta Cass is with an equally bright star one third of the width of the 40mm eyepiece distant.<br /><br />Achird is double!<br /><br />Is Kappa Cass in the middle of an open cluster?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Perseus<br /></strong><br />Algol - when in eclipse, use alpha Andromeda and Kappa Perseii (K) as comp stars.<br /><br />Mirphak plus surrounding stars is beautiful.<br /><br />Sword Handle (NGC 884/869  - each is 29 arcmin across. Spot the red stars in these clusters.<br /><br />NGC 1528 - C shaped cluster<br /><br />M76 - Little Dumbbell planetary nebula<br /><br />M34 open cluster best seen in binoculars<strong><br /><br /><br /></strong>
