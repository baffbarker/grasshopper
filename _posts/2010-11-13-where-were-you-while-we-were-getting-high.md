This posting has a while to formulate properly in my mind but it has as its heart a vain attempt to understand what the hell the counter culture of the sixties was all about, and why it is still important today.

The war was well and truly over by the 1950s,  and following the reconstruction and the end rationing, people stared to enjoy a higher standard of living. During that time the ideal life was promoted by the marketing men, and there rose a new market in processed foods to make the housewife's life easier. A very conformist world view ensued, in which science could finally defeat many agricultural problems, pesticides could kill nasties in the crops, fertilisers would boost yields, and latest drugs could cure ill people who previously might die.

Another awe inspiring event in 1969 was that man landed on the moon. It now seemed that anything was possible. It was simply a matter of time before we colonised space, and our evolutionary progress was starwards. however upon later reflection on the recent anniversary discussions of this seminal event, it wasn't the moon we discovered but the earth. The moon was found to be a dead cold wasteland. However the astronauts looked backwards and were awestruck by the beauty of the blue planet from which they had come.  One wonderful by product of those missions was the science of remote sensing, which has played a large role in my life as a geographer.

However there was a dark side to all this. It was the publication of Rachel Carson's  "Silent Spring"  in the 1960s which opened up new worries about what was being done to our food supply.  This gave rise to the organic food movement, where the chemical free growing of food came to be seen as a political act, as much as anything else. There was also a reaction against conformism, known as being "square" in the parlance of the day, and the ideal was seen as to be free, liv free, "Turn on tune in and drop out" was the order of the day. It was the advent of the Beatles "Sergeant Pepper" album with its innovatory techniques which inspired a generation.

The late seventies saw a decline on the movement and the punk ethos took over,  however it never died it just mutated into other forms. The music it engendered did become unfashionable, yet the philosophy stayed around in the form of CND, the anti-roads protests and the traveller movement. I think that this strand of thinking is manifest also in the internet itself, ´the free software movement, and the burgeoning permaculture and Transition Town movement. It shows that the deep thinking which lies behind many of these seemingly disparate strands of thought actually have (in my humble opinion) the same roots.

Penultimately I offer a classic piece of music from that era, Tim Blake's Jerusalem, full of the optimism of that era, infinite experimentalism with sound, belief in ley lines and the magical power of Stonehenge as some kind of place of pilgrimage:

There was a reason this piece held my imagination. I lived in north Wales,  a land full of ancient ruins and belief in magic other than the rational world. Above my village lay this wonderful stone circle shown below, which used to attract locals every summer solstice.
