Feeling a bit fed up today, remembering the day back when when people such as my wife and I were stars. We both practise something known as Geographic Information Systems, back in the day - we are talking early 1990s, we were both young, excited and (at least in my wife's case) good looking. Back then, the gear you needed to do GIS was very heavy duty and expensive. Let me describe it.

You needed to input the maps by hand. Because the maps were HUGE, sometimes A0 size, you needed a big table to place your map upon. You needed to learn topology, as when you digitized polygon after polygon, the computer - either a huge Sun Workstation or a super powered 386 IBM PC if you were lucky, would make beeps, a high beep if the polygon "snapped", or a low beep if it failed. Then would come hours at the PC making sure the polygons all had integrity and fit together.

The other end of the business was the plotter. Before the inkjet days, these were enormous complex systems, with pens which needed replacing often. A complicated map might take two hours to plot. In the middle stood a paperweight Sun Workstation or a Tektronix workstation linked to a VAX mainframe which would be the centrepiece of such a lab.

You'd set off a job, and come back to your GIS Lab next morning.

Ah, a GIS "Lab". I built one up in my Saudi research institute worth 50,00 dollars, I was so proud. I was one of those evangelised by the subject, how it would change the world, how we'd be able to map soil erosion creeping down a slope, how we'd map how Saddam might destroy the Arabian Gulf habitats. I found myself battling for my life upside down in the Red Sea with the "lung" icon flashing on my dive computer as I lacked adequate dive experience yet wanted so much to be part of mapping the Red Sea. All for a map. I found myself in between flaming oil platforms in the Arabian Gulf mapping shallow banks in the Abu Safah oilfield, and holding on for dear life as we hurtled back at 60kph back to Dammam port. I would have almost died for the subject I believed so much in it.

Then what happened? All the systems we learnt as students, spent hours reading the manuals, weekends even, reading up for our careers, how to model this, how to plot that. All eventually came to nought. We were experts in our fields. We were sent to exotic tropical countries (especially those with decent trekking mountains or beaches) to teach the spear throwing natives how to map their lands. I was flown into Mongolia, like a doctor with a briefcase coming in haste to tend a sick patient (Mongolia's soils). Then I arrived and to my shock found they knew more than I did. These primitive people were bloody good at this stuff. They were enterprising, hard working and very very clever. Yes, cleverer than us.

So, here is a eulogy for the GIS "experts" of us who did back then enjoy minor celebrity status, and have lost it to some tiny "app" on some mobile phone. I had the exciting privilege of working for the very first photogrammetric company in Europe, only sadly to discover they were sending all the jobs to India. We'd email them the files to work on in their sweatshops poor buggers, and they'd come back with all manner of errors, the funniest of which was not understanding the "Sharp S" in German - a sort of huge "B" in a way, used most commonly in the word "Strasse". Back would come faithful copies of work, only with "StraBe"!!!! We important "project managers" were reduced to the level of cartographic toilet cleaners. Rather fittingly when the company went bust, we dragged those huge old digitizing tables off to the dump.

So with tongue firmly in cheek, we offer up the following ditty meant to be sung like the Buggles song:

<strong><em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star</em></strong>

<em>I saw you on the SunSparc back in Ninety Two. </em>

<em>Lying awake learning plotting on the CPU. </em>

<em>When I was young I didn't stop learning all about you.</em>

<em>Oh-a oh </em>

<em>They took the credit for my awesome new map</em>

<em>And now it's some shitty tiny app.</em>

<em>Destroyed by mobiles and new technology, and now I understand the</em>
<em>problems you can see. </em>

<em>Oh-a oh </em>

<em>I taught your children</em>

<em>Oh-a oh</em>

<em>What did you tell them? </em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star. </em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star. </em>

<em>Inkjets came and broke your heart.</em>

<em>Oh-a-a-a oh </em>

<em>And now we meet in an abandoned mapping lab. </em>

<em>We hear the plotter and it seems so long ago.</em>

<em>And you remember how the cartridges used to go.</em>

<em>Oh-a oh </em>

<em>You were the first one.</em>

<em> Oh-a oh</em>

<em>You were the last one. </em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star</em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star </em>

<em>On my map and in my chair, we can't replot it isn't fair </em>

<em>Oh-a-aho oh,</em>

<em>Oh-a-aho oh </em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star </em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star</em>

<em>On my map and in my chair, we can't replot it isn't fair , </em>

<em>Phone apps came and broke your heart,</em>

<em>Put the blame on God knows who, </em>

<em>You are a mapping star. </em>

<em>You are a mapping star. </em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star</em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star</em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star</em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star</em>

<em>Mobile Apps killed the GIS Star</em>

<em>(You are a mapping star.)</em>
