This goes to show how difficult it is to do this health thing.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rollercoaster up...</span><br /><br />As recommended by John Walker I sat there with my gram measuring scales this morning calculating how much gloop I slop on my <span style="font-style:italic;">semmel</span> or breakfast roll. I weighed the half of semmel at 30g then after careful measuring weighed the butter at 10g and the honey (fantastic local organic from our town) at 10g. All well and good....<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rollercoaster down...</span><br /><br />A visit from a friend this afternoon brought cake before this gullible one's eyes, which was duly finished off.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rollercoaster up again...</span><br /><br />Utterly sick of the typical Christmas thing I began to surf the <a href="http://www.vegsoc.org/info/basic-nutrition.html">Vegetarian Society</a> website says about what our body really needs. It seems armed with this knowledge we can make informed choices about what we eat. I think we as a family are headed towards a veggie lifestyle in future as I just came to the conclusion that I am uncomfortable around meat and scared of its preparation. I always thought that learning to roast a chicken was some kind of advanced goal in cookery but this I am questioning now. <br /><br />Before Christmas I purchased Brussels sprouts hoping to eat them with the goose, however I realised only red cabbage and dumplings or <span style="font-style:italic;">Kn√∂del</span> fit to this meal. They lay in the fridge awaiting development until this evening when I found <a href="http://http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/goldencrusted-brussels-sprouts-recipe.html">this</a> way to cook them. However the verdict was that they were a bit hard. I think steaming them next time would help. Will retain an open mind on this recipe and return later.<br /><br />Our neighbour who in fact has I believe Macedonian roots recommended I try Bulghur Wheat. A while back I bought some. A quick Google gave us the Arabic recipe of <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/lentils-with-bulgur-wheat-and-caramelized-onions-moujadara-with-burghul-recipe/index.html">Mujadarra</a> which always takes my eyes wistfully eastwards to hot days floating on the Arabian Gulf with sunlight blocked by an Arabian dhow gliding by. Will have try that.<br /><br />The family didn't like my sprout recipe so I dug into the fridge again and found a load of carrots. Before Christmas I bought a juicer. It's not the best designed of kitchen gadgets - the stuff leaks out sometimes - but it's a good introduction to <a href="http://www.juicing-for-health.com/vegetable-juicing.html">juicing</a> and I duly plopped some carrots into it, which we sank well.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rollercoaster back down again...</span><br /><br />We end this post on a sad note.<br /><br />Was surfing about the web early evening only to be dragged over by Wife to watch Take That with her on the tally. Good entertainment now from a group I used to absolutely hate in the 80s as manufactured pop. The evening's music was enjoyed with a couple of glasses of red wine, a couple of eggnogs, 3-4 biscuits, a few jelly bears and a beer lemonade <span style="font-style:italic;">Radler</span>. Shit.
