<em>Please allow me to introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste</em>

For those who have been uninitiated into the cesspit which Jimmy Saville's death blew the lid off, I shall here give anyone who happens by my blog a brief guide top how to follow what may become the scandal of the century- it my make the Profumo scandal a picnic in comparison when it all comes out.

What you need to get into is Twitter. Many of the players are there, and you will find out soon enough by searching under hashtags "#fernbridge" and #fairbanks". Operation Fairbanks is the police operation set up following Tom Watson's announcement last October of a paedophile network operating out of Number Ten Downing Street. Follwing that scoping exercise the police decided that there was sufficient evidence to set up Operation Fernbridge, which is what hopefully will deliver the goods, i.e., justice.

My preference is to follow via Tweetdeck, which is a columnar format which allows me to quickly scan each hastag stream. I also follow three pretty active blogs which have been frequently first to break the stories everyone else has followed, so all credit to these three bloggers:

http://hat4uk.wordpress.com/ The Slog - excellent

http://aangirfan.blogspot.de/ - Aangirfan - bugger to spell but also good. Mentions the excellent digging work of Murun Buchstansangur.

http://www.chrisspivey.co.uk/ I love Spivey! His writing is direct and to the point! No mincing of words, sometimes he puts up pretty horrific pics but they are the truth. He is an ex-journo so knows his stuff.

As far as blogs go I follow:

http://daffodilrites.blogspot.co.uk/ she is a direct Saville Abuse Survivor and must be listened to!

https://renegadesblog.wordpress.com/ mentions Satanism.

http://ynysmam.blogspot.de/ Lives on Anglesey and knew Steven Messham. Some of his stories I have to laugh, e.g, the story abiout the laybys near Menai Bridge being used by gay "cottagers" shocked me! Shows how innocent my life really is!

What underpins it all, is Satanism. If anyone is interested, I can start to summarise the links I have found in this regard.

Good reading, and remember to give your babies an extra tight hug after seeing what out power elite are doing to us in plain sight.
