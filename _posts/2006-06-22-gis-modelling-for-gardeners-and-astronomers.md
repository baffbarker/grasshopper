Right then,<br /><br />Given that I have this passion for GIS and doing something for the people, here goes:<br /><br />I have this wonderful garden and am glued to Gardeners World when the World Cup isn'T on.<br /><br />It is two interests I am focussing on for this posting. Gardening has got into me deeply and I am keen as a mapping man to know if I can use soil and climate data to assess the conditions for my garden, maybe not only my own garden but gardens in Britain and Germany. Hre are the models I am poroposing:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Gardening</span> <br /><br />This model is intended to determine what plants will grow best in the given location.<br /><br />The theory is presented thus:<br /><br />Plant suitability = f(soil type, rainfall, date of first frost, date of last frost)<br /><br />I intend to map the information by British postcode.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Astronomy</span> <br /><br />Clear skies mapping is the focus here.<br /><br />Her is my GIS model:<br /><br />Limiting magnitude visible = f(altitude, number of days cloud freeper year, population density)<br /><br />The population density is related to light pollution.<br /><br />Any ideas to comment on this?
