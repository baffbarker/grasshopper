Update...<br /><br />I have chosen to immerse myself in MapServer which I believe to be the new way forward in web GIS, over commercial systems like ArcIMS.<br /><br />My data is now all prepared thanks to GRASS. We have the following:<br /><br />1. Landsat data downloaded and processed in the GRASS GIS.<br />2. SRTM DEM data processed in the same way.<br />3. GNIS Global Names Server data processed using a Python script kindly sent to me by MAtthew Perry. I streamed the Germany data through but myay have to do the same for the Austria dataset. One of the exceedingly kind helpers I have had along the way.<br />4. VMAP. I am uncertain as to the copyright on this data. Still need to see what others are doing.<br /><br />So the data is already in a special directory on my PC. I have received a few kind offers to host it and will be chasing those up when I am ready.<br /><br />Next task is to get a decent HTML page up and runing to host the template for the Mapserver script file.
