Right then,

Here is a concept which has been gestating in my mind a while. It concerns pretty much the way things have run the last few years in the UK.

To my mind, if you wish to see what made Britain great, not the flag waving Empire rubbish but the humble way we used to go about our day, just watch an old episode of Camberwick Green or Dads Army. In there you will see what life used to be like before the evil revolution which came upon us during the Thatcher era and has been destroying us ever since. 

In either show you have a local slightly pompous yet trustworthy bank manager (Captain Mainwaring) where your local bank has the job of taking care of your wealth and lending it out locally to businesses or home buyers (not to invest your money in arms or drugs like chips in a casino). The very idea of being in debt is seen as shameful, let alone buying anything other than a house on a secured loan.

The baker or rather the miller (Windy Miller) receives locally grown wheat and mills it for the benefit of a local bakery which is from here you receive your staff of life, not some mechanised Hovis flogged to you via a nostalgic advert with Dvorak's New World Symphony as a soundtrack. The Trumpton Fire Brigade is an outlet for the local's brave souls - paid for by the local council. If you have any deeper issues you discuss them with a local parson whom you respect as a pillar of the local community.

Now contrast this golden rose tinted view with what Britain has become. The expenses scandal in Parliament (duck hotels anyone?) was perhaps the first scandal where the politicos were seen as having their snouts in the trough, thanks to the Telegraph (though I'd always thought it was pro establishment more fool me). During the 80s we suffered the rise of Rupert Murdoch's Sky TV empire based upon Arthur C Clarke's technology. Last year they attempted to take over Britain's broadcasting. Has anyone ever trawled through the non BBC/ITV/CH4 channels when bored? It is a mix of US TV evangelists, Islamic stuff and very warped erotica with girls not entirely naked slapping themselves. Is this what they meant by "consumer choice"?

His evil empire's facade cracked when it was revealed that it had hacked the phone of a murdered girl. People had been complaining for years until then but this was the straw which broke the camel's back. Thanks to the Guardian's bravery in printing what had really been going on we now know his empire's operations were more sordid than we thought.

So now to last autumn when we learned that Jimmy Saville was a paedophile. I will not regurgitate what has been written but the real story is not him, it is the paedophile ring to which Tom Watson alluded when he stood up in Parliament last autumn. To trawl the Internet sites covering this search for "Fairbanks" on Twitter and read the blogs referred to.

It all adds up to a systematic destruction of all the institutions we knew and respected years ago, the BBC, the Government, the media. Our democracy has been taken from us. I am now wondering if this was all part of some sick plan at the top, by a shadow government which has always ruled Britain for hundreds of years. Royalty, civil service (unelected), the public school system all seem to live in a world entirely separate from us. Following 9/11 (which I deeply question as being by Osama Bin Laden) a million people were said to have marched on London to protest the bombing of Iraq yet it still took place. We seem to be at endless war against Muslims who in my personal experience were always so civilised and friendly. The question must thus be asked:

WHO FUCKED BRITAIN?
