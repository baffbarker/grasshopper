Back in the 70s, almost everyone cracked "nigger" and "poof" jokes. Â - look at the generation of comedians Jim Davidson represents - they were huge back then as lots of people held those views. I am glad that era's bigotry did die though.

It was uncool to go to church and be Christian. Look at how bands like Black Sabbath (I still love them in spite of this blog posting) sang about dark stuff, and how Christian values were seen as uncool, and taking lots of drugs to "expand your mind" was so in at the time.

I am not any kind of conservative person, yet I am now questioning how it came to be that ordinary family life came to be demonised so much in Britain. Was there some kind of agenda to destroy the family as we know it? I live in Chrstian Bavaria, with its old traditions still alive. How much of the social values intruduced in Britain in the last 30 years were from the Dark Forces?

Given it is believed that the drug LSD (I never liked manmade drugs, yet I took an awesome trip on psylocybin which basically helped me write my BA thesis) is believed to originate in the CIA's so named MK Ultra programme, was the entire counterculture thing set up by the Dark Ones too?
