Following the sgort back and sides of the hedge the last week I purchased a tonne of compost to spread on the base of the hedge, as recommended in Gardeners World recently.<br /><br />The rest went on a new lawn patch up job, all fenced off to stop the babies running over it. Just then a huge hailstorm came and washed all my new soil into a small lake in the garden. So it goes.
