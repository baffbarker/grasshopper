Erm, well...not quite crude oil, rather olive oil.<br /><br />We've heard that a Mediterranean Diet is supposed to reduce our LDL cholesterol levels but it may be possible that the oilve oil in supermarkets may be adulterated with hazelnut oil. Check <a href="http://www.truthquest2.com/oliveoilscandal.htm">this</a> out. Recent surfing about has uncovered a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12571726">scandal</a> incolving corruption on a large scale involving these oils, and they may be able to get away with it given that there are no standards applied to olive oil like other foodstuffs. There exists a body named <a href="http://www.internationaloliveoil.org/">The International Oilve Oil Council</a> but as yet I am unaware of how it operates.<br /><br />Best still might be to buy fair trade olive oil. Given the current troubles in the Middle East, it may be great to purchase oil <a href="http://www.zatoun.com/">from these people</a>
