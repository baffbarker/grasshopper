Just this morning a woman came to the door begging for the circus. Upon asking which one she told me it was the vary same one I'd seen only a few hundred metres from my home with the kids in summer.  I gave her 2 Euros as I'd had so much respect for their hard work. They'd set up on a field near kindergarten and I watched them set it up over the days, their rehearsals, and simply saw how unbelievably tough their lives were.  The actual show was nice and just like we used to get in Blighty, horses running round a ring, llamas, baby pony and acrobats and clowns. We went to a performance and the kids just loved it. From what I saw the animals were treated very well. All in all a good show. She asked did I have old food, so I gave some stale bread, some carrots from the frisge and some celery which I won't finish, so that's my scout good turn for the day done.
