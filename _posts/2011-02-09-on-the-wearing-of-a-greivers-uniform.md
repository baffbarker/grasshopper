At the foot of the Troodos Mountains in Cyprus lies the old village of Kakopetria, a wonderful old medieval Mediterranean hamlet which we visited when my late uncle was stationed in Larnaca in 1981. Walking down its streets were old ladies dressed in black wearing black hoods which wiki- research has revealed they are widows and stay that way once their menfolk "move on". Now its plain to see they are different, they wear this "uniform" which tells the outside world of their membership of the "club".

Now I'd like some form of universally recognised sign of my status. In the marketplace this morning I visited my friendly market stall. At the moment I am conflicted between wanting people and solitude. Â Half of me wants to explode while half of me wants to be alone. Out of the blue one of the sweet ladies asked me in German about my Mum (I must have mentioned she was in hospital last week I cannot remember - we have a nice rapport and gossip in the shop often). Upon telling them my Mum had died they all stared at me and I wished the earth would just come and swallow me up at that point, as I feel i am being stared at now as a strange one. It is a living hell being foreign and grieving at the same time.

All I can muster to announce my status is to feel like yelling "Fuck off I'm grieving" to all and sundry.
