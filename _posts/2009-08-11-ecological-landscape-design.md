This is my fourth summer tending my garden. There've been some successes and failures. If I might criticise myself in some way about gardening, it seems there is no "central" idea unifying my gardening activities.

Enter the concept of permaculture. For a long time it seemed somehow iut of reach to me like an advanced gardening system. Then I borrowed a copy of "Gaia's Garden" and it set off "mind bombs" in me. I've been growing stuff a few years now with to be honest no real idea what I was doing. Thanks to the ideas put forth in this tome I now have a focus and a direction i didnt have before.

I'm going to try to upload pics of my garden this summer to show some kind of "before" idea, as I am hoping I'll have nicer pics next year if the ideas are implemented as presented.
