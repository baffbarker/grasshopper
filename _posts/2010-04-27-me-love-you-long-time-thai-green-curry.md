Right then,

From what I remember of the curries in Thailand they had this wonderful smooth texture, which present "plop all in the mixer" methods don't achieve. I'm going to adopt the principle used in the Real Curry Recipes Indian food site, that of mixing everything together then at the last minute blending everything together into a lovely paste.

I'm going to apply what I know of Asian techniques here to the making of Thai curry. it requires thinking in depth about each ingredient and what it actually does to the food, and how each can be optimised to enhance the flavour of the final dish. First here's a list of the ingredients:

2-3 Shallots,
Coriander leaves,
Coriander,
Cumin,
Juice of 1 lime,
Kaffir lime leaves
1 tbsp Nam Pla fish sauce 
1 tin coconut milk
0.5 to 1 chili
3 stalks lemongrass, bashed
3 cloves garlic
1 tbsp Palm sugar 
Groundnut oil
1 inch pc ginger
0.5 tsp black peppercorns

Step 1.

Dry roast the cumin and coriander. It enhances their flavours

Step 2.

Make what is known in Indian cuisine a "tarka" - gently sweat the onions as long as possible. Don_riina on Toytown recommends even as long as 30 minutes on very low heat.
