In spite of a lot of faffing about I now have my weight loss thing set up on The Hackers Diet Online. You can see it on the icon right of here.<br /><br />Yesterday I noted the number of kilojoules used so will note that today and find out what that means. It read 6669 at my last training session.<br /><br />Npow that is set up I need to figure out the calories/kilojoules system. The "Diet" section of the PDF will be ny next segment to understand.
