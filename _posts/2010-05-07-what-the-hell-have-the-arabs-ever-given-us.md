Right then,

This post follows my train of thought after the marvellous programme by Bettany Hughes on the Moors last week. I started thinking about how much we actually owe the Arabs and according to her show, the list is impressive:

Love poetry from the Moors to the troubadours in Spain. The entire Western ethos of romantic yet unrequited love.

Music - the guitar came originally from Spain then was developed by the likes of Sor, Tarrega, and all. Without their mastery of this instrument there'd have been no Robert Johnson, no Jimi Hendrix and no modern entire rock history.

Algebra: many Western words have as their beginning the word "al" and this indicated in most cases an Arab origin. Indeed the Arabic numerals were found to be speedier than the cumbersome Roman numerals for banking and finance.

Alcohol - yay, one of the best.

Hashish - According to David Morel the Arabic link between the word "Hashish" and "Assassin" is deep- the Sheikh would give his subject a garden with concubines, all the alcohol and hashish he wanted. Then he took it away and told the man he'd get it back if he killed someone. 

The Renaissance - modern history has taught us that the libraries of Alexandria were sacked by (Forgotten who) but the knowledge was all lost to time. No according to the programme it resurfaced at Toledo in Spain than found its way to Florence and Rome where exploded the Renaissance. Buried in the seed of the Renaissance was the premise of questioning all thought. Under liberal Islam this was a revolutionary way of thinking.

This is just a small fragment of the huge legacy we've owe the Arabs. Can anyone think of any more?
