Here's a thought. The wood fires I burn all of course send smoke through my chimney. That of course is a current of hot air. Now is it possible to either:<br /><br />1. Install a fireproof wind turbine inside the chimney to spin using the generated hot air or,<br /><br />2. Perhaps fit a horizontal "Savionius" turbine on the top of the chimney which could use not only hot air from the fire but also any wind in the locality.<br /><br />Has anyone thought about this? That's a load of free moving hot air which is being wasted.
