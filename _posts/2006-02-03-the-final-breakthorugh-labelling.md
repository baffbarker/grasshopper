Thanks to the friendly Mapserver community and a question answered by Brock Anderson I can now add labels to my Maperver application. It has been weeks to get this done owing to lots of other comittmnents - masinly the birth of my sin! But now the following work in Mapsewrver for Bavaria:<br /><br />SRTM elevation data<br />Landsat imagery<br />VMAP rivers, roads, etc<br />Geonet place names<br /><br />So now all work okay. All I need to do now is to put them all together.<br /><br />Success!
