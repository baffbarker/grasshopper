Was informed via an internet forumn for expats here in Germany about the "GoldenBantam" protest movement here. If you plant "Golden Bantam" sweetcorn for seed saving you must legally be informed whether they are growing GM crops near you.<br /><br />Seems a great way to protest GM.<br /><br />http://www.bantam-mais.de/
