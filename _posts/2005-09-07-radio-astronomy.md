Tonight I present three URLs:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.users.waitrose.com/~spa/Images/ncrom019.pdf"></a><br /><br />This was sent by Jeff Stevens in Stoke of the SPA web forum. Thanks Jeff. It is a PDF which describes the methods used to build a radio telescope as used in the Radio Jove Jupiter project.<br /><br />I am starting to read about radio astronomy. The father if you will of this science was a chap named Karl Jansky. A short biography is written about him here: <a href="http://www.bigear.org/vol1no4/jansky.htm"></a><br /><br />Finally I came across this link which describes radio astronomy for beginner, i.e., people like me.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bigear.org/guide.htm"></a><br /><br />I would write more but I want to go back to reading this stuff.
