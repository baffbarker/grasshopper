In a word, gold.

Yup I think I've sussed what is going on in Germany. These planners think long and they realise oil is on the way out as a tradeable commodity. Not the quantity of it (peak oil is only a concept if you extract it in the American way - Russians use the abiotic method. What is at stake is its stability of supply. If you read Zero Hedge a while back you will have read of the Germans wanting to repatriate their gold from the US. The US gracefully went downstairs to the cellars and took a peak and found that the gold bars were not actually gold at all but tungsten - someone had nicked the gold! They were no more gold than one of those Ferrero Roche gold covered choccies. Since the world is headed for gold not oil and is on the brink of rejecting the petrodollar the stakes are high. Germany is totally over a barrel right now and if it threatens to go East to Vlad the Lad then oh dear - it has this mess on its doorstep.

And that's the game plan. Keep the Jerries under with this problem to stop them going east. Very simple strategy.

And on that note we interlude to the classic of the 80s. For the Brits here the host in Thomas Gottschalk the host of Germany's flagship show "Wetten Dass...?" here for decades:
