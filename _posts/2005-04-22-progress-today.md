Succeeded today I finding the correct site for the Landsat imagery. Image size is 20-30 megs - okay.<br /><br />OpenGIS seems to increase somewhat in traffic.<br /><br />Pointed by Opengis to Berlin Bike Site. Cool but does it use copyright data?<br /><br />Discovered yesterday river data and emailed Nick Whitelegg at Freemap. He was impressed and will investigate it.<br /><br />GPS worked briefly today! Magellan emailed me with a reset hack.<br /><br />Next step: download GRASS at home/work and get it running
