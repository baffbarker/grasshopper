Here is a link to an interview with a chap I've recently been made aware of (Thanks Katrina of TT!)  who has two simple rules for his foods to choose:

<strong>Rule 1:</strong>
<blockquote>So, I’ve had to update my rules. And with all this new marketing based on these ideas, my new suggestion is, if you want to avoid all this,<strong> simply don’t buy any food you’ve ever seen advertised.</strong> Ninety-four percent of ad budgets for food go to processed food. I mean, the broccoli growers don’t have money for ad budgets. So the real food is not being advertised. And that’s really all you need to know.</blockquote>
<strong>Rule 2: </strong>
<blockquote>You know, another piece of advice from In Defense of Food is, <strong>don’t eat any food that comes with a health claim.</strong> It sounds counterintuitive, but if you’re worried about your health, that is not the healthy food. The healthy food is in the produce section. It’s sitting there very quietly, without budgets to do this research, without budgets for marketing, without packages to print health claims on. So just kind of tune that out.</blockquote>
With comments like this, he's rapidly going to be taken seriously in the next few years.
