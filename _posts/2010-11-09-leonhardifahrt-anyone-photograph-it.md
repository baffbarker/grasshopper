Last weekend, and I think the weekend before, was the tradition of Leonard Fart, which apparently consists of Bavarians dressing up yet again in Tracht (do they ever take these clothes off? do they ever get them washed?).

Sarcasm aside, it's a very nice looking tradition, with loads of horses and carts in a procession. I missed the one near me as I was chopping down a tree deep in Oberpfalz, better known as the German Congo (fab place to chill away from the Munich crowds btw)

Well did anyone get out and take any pics of this tradition? If you did of this year or the last few years, send em over to me. I'll put 'em up here.
