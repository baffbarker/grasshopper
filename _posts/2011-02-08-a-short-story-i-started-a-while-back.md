Here I publish the opening lines of a short story I started a few weeks ago before all this hell broke loose. Perhaps it will be my saving, as a Â kind of therapy.

I've had this story in mind a while now, about a man who embodies elements of the EW Hornung Raffles character, Secret millionaire, and Da Vinci Code all rolled into one. The world's first non-violent gentleman criminal who steals beautiful works of art belonging to arsehole tax evaders, then sells it on to someone and gives entirely the proceeds to a deserving cause. Think of it as an act which our government should be doing but isn't. Taxation as it should be done!

&nbsp;

Without further ado, we introduce our charismatic villain:

-------------------------------------------------------------

His phone rang, with its special ringtone from his contact.

Whenever the phone rang a nerve would twitch in his stomach. He never quite knew where the new mission would take him, but accept it he must. Danger and risk were his life as usual, yet he felt driven to achieve by his sense of altruism, and a desire to right a wrong. The mobile sprang to life, the protagonist whom he knew well he'd programmed in to play (tune) so he knew exactly who was ringing.

He pressed the "Accept Call" button, breathed deeply and spoke as calmly as possible.

"Loxley"

"Robert is it you? We have a new one"

"Where`?"

"It's a youth group in Leicester. They desperately need some help or they''ll go under"

"How much?"

"About thirtty grand"

"I'll try and net forty. I need to make some calls"

"Right you are. (Click)"

&nbsp;

And so would begin a new mission. Dialling one of his old mates, he tried to calm his breathing,

"Hi Robert here"

"Ah, nice one. You been called up again?"

"Yep"

"Good lad. we have a new one"

"Where?"

"A particularly noxious chap, refuses to pay HMG around fifty grand he owes. Go and scope his house out and carry out your job"

"Can you email details to my Hotmail account as usual?"

"We can even send you a Google Earth of his house if you want"

"Perfect. Then consider the mission on, and you'll hear a Tweet from me when it's over"

"Right you are, sir"
