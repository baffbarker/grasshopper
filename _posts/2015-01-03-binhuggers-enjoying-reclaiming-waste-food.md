The last six months I have been cooking as never before - in exchange for driving a trailer full of cardboard to the recycling centre which accepts cardboard boxes - I receive free or very cheap whole boxes of veg and fruit. Sometimes the stuff is of course not fresh and has to be composted but still a huge chunk of it is usable and makes fantastic food.

The trick is to be relaxed and open as to what to cook. The further secret is to have on hand the basics so when it comes in it can be dealt with quickly.

As long as you have the base Western aromatics - onions or leeks, carrots and celery - you can pop what's there very often into a veggie lasagne - mushrooms, peppers, for example. A load of peppers can be roasted with tomatoes and rosemary for an awesome sauce topping for couscous for example.

If there's a cauliflower then the obvious direction to go is cauliflower cheese so you have to have milk, cheese and butter on hand for the Bechamel. If there's any interest I'll write about some of my decisions and recipes I discover.

I am now a fruithead. If there are pears they get the dead simple poaching treatment in a pan of water and sugar five minutes then whipped cream over that. Bananas get gently cooked in butter/sugar then wrapped up on puff pastry as a Banana Bomb! If it's fruit glut season then the glut will end up in jam jars! This is what I did last summer with 10 kg of strawberries!
