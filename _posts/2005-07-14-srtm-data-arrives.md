Thanks to the kindness of Jeffrey Johnson in the States, my long awaited SRTM data has arrived. He asked me what I intended to do with it. I have small dream things I'd like to do like thermal maps like I did years back in Bangor, but the other significant "project" which is more pressing than this GIS is the care of my daughter who I am now responsible for since I lost my job. So the postings here may drop a little. <br /><br />BTW pleasae send comments and feedback on this blog! Is there anyone out there reading it?
