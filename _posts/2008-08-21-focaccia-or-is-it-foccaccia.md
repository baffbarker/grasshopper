Well last night was cabbage soup from the allotment buled out with some Italian bread made as per usual method of yeast, water, olive oil, salt, sugar and organic flour but with the difference of three longs sprigs of rosemary from the garden, and simply flattening it out on a baking tray in the oven. Looked good. On its own it's a bit dull but with nice cheese like Gruyere it tastes great.<br /><br />My wife has named it Kaka Bread though. Kaka is German for poo.
