I've had an interest awakened by Time Team on More4, in plane table mapping. In order to carry this out you need to do the following:

1. Establish a known fixed point, a "datum" as it were.

2. Place the levelled table over the datum, and capture points using the plane table's alidade.

3. Plot the outline of the object say a building, using the points as a guide in google Earth or an ortho image.

1. After using the Android app, "GPS Averaging" I established the following datum in my garden:

N47°52.339 E11°41.687 Error: ±0.2m (20cm accuracy!) Altitude: 737.8m Taken with 43 measurements.

2. I started to reengineer an app downloaded and inserted into MIT AppInventor which measures the azimuth value. My aim is to see how accurate the bearing measurement is in Android. Mental note: make sure I use Firefox not Opera for my browser in MIT-AI!!!
