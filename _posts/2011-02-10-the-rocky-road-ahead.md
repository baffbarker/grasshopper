Today was the first where I woke up after what may be described as a "normal" night's sleep in inverted commas. The first day since the event where I felt what I would describe as "not shit". I've had weird stomach pains the last few days, particularly all down my chest muscles which felt like I had been doing a load of sit ups. I start to think about getting back to some exercise but not quite yet as my whole system feels depleted.

We must take it one day at a time. Today is okay but there are nasty potholes ahead which one might fall into. it is going to be rough. Having had harrowing experiences before i am fairly well "harrowed", so I feel I have the coping strategies to get through the  dark days to come.

I think there will be living reminders coming back like flashbacks. This morning my son cried as he has a hurting tooth. i clearly remember when I'd go to my Mum with loose milk teeth she'd ask to look and touch it with her finger. Before I knew it she'd push it out! Such as we were.

Then came the phenomenon of the 5p piece under the pillow by next morning.  As things are surging into my memory which I am blessed is a good long term one (pity i can't say the same about my short term grey matter) this was in the 1970s when there were still slightly tarnished old shillings about. If you got a post decimal coin it would have those bits of holly or whatever they were on, but if lucky the words "One Shilling" plus some Roman stuff were etched into the coin.
