Right then, I've got his dust-gathering pile of old scrawls sitting in old files, together with boxes of 35mm slides sitting on shelves, so this is my start to make some use of all those days spent in a dusty Lada or old boneshaker buses across India. This was spurred by reading Thor Heyerdahl's "Kon Tiki" book.

I've homebound now, but in the past I wasn't. I made triups across deserts, mountains and seas, and had fantastic times in the process.

I flew to the roof of the world in 1992 to Ladakh, tried to climb its peak Stok Kangri but was thwarted by a car crash and altitude sickness. I cross the Arabian deserts many times hunting for fossils, flowers and animals (not in the literal sense of the word). I cross the Gobi in Mongolia in an old Russian bus.

I trekked in the Indian Himalaya of Ladakh and Kumaon, the Nepal Himalaya several times. I learned to scuba dive and snorkelled in the Arabian Gulf and Red Sea. It's now time to start to make sense of those experiences, and to most of all convey the fun I had doing so.

If anyone has a wish list let me know...
