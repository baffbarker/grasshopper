Four candles! Nope not the Two Ronnies sketch, for real this time.

Today I fought off the winter lethargy to which I am so prone and  dragged my bod with two excited kids just before dusk to fetch evergreen twigs. They were both on scooters - I can't believe how fast they drive them. Off we went in the fading light to the forest edge near our house armed with basket, gloves and secateurs. The sky was a little leaden and grim but that still didn't dampen spirits.

We assigned our jobs: I cut down the small branches whilst Dominic held the basket. Elena passed the branches from me to him, so they both felt very important. It is sometimes a challenge to allot tasks to each small one and involves creative thinking, which I am sometimes sort of when nerves get frayed!

Basket full it was almost dark when we returned home, and pitch balck when we came in. I'd previously thought these projects impossible, but seen Sabine in kindergarten - Elena's teacher - use a trick with rolled up newspaper. You roll them up just like you are making fire logs - remember the old trick? Then make a ring and wrap wire round them and form a circle. Once you have your structure you then wind round the branches until the paper is covered. You then make small holes in which to insert four candles. I wrapped a ribbon I found lying around onto it then thought it still looked a bit bare, so I went out in the blackness to cut off a piece of holly bush growing near my man shed. I thus inserted the leaves into the ring.

Upon reading the wiki about "Adventzkränze", I learned that the origin is actually pagan, the circle having symbolic significance. I've always been a bit put off over-sentimental Christian stuff but when I learned that many of our German and British traditions have deeper older roots in the cycles of nature then I became more interested to look at them again as a way to connect with nature. I love looking at the four candles in winter, each week one extra is lit, until they are all lit at Christmas.

So here's a pic of my little work. I'm really proud.
