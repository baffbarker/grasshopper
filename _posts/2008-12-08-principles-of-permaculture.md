<p>Found this link to aid understanding of the principles of permaculture by David Holmgren who is one of the founding fathers of the permaculture movement in Australia. </p><p><a href="http://www.holmgren.com.au/DLFiles/PDFs/Essence_of_PC_eBook.pdf">http://www.holmgren.com.au/DLFiles/PDFs/Essence_of_PC_eBook.pdf</a> </p><p>I seem to already practice some of these in a way, but I wonder if it's possible to take each principle and turn it into an action?</p>
