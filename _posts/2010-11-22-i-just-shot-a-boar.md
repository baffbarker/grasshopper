...or rather in the readership company of Michael Pollan. I must say the intensity with which he descries this act is deeply moving. He mentions the works of Wendell Berry a lot throughout the book, a writer I simply must obtain more thoughts from in my musings on food and its origins.

<a>Interview with michael Pollan</a>

A visit to Jasberg farm yesterday Â underpinned all I believe about local food. The act of deciding to go there, the drive with the amazing view afforded of The Alps (hazy yesterday or I'd have tried one of my panorama shots) and the arrival, heralded by clucking hens running about, the countryside smell, and the queue we had to make behind all the others "in the know" about this special place. For inside is this sweet smell of food, a really well run butchers deep in the country, the industry of a family who only open on Saturday mornings, and the produce! Large containers of apple juice, sheepskins, wine, cheese, butter, bread. All locally made.

And the meat! Freshly slaughtered they have their own version of a Chorizo, the Jasberger, which we always buy some of. They tend to supply mostly beef and pork products, but time to time there appear specialties such as game or maybe geese if its a Catholic festival such as Martinstag, or Leonhardifahrt. If i am unsure what to cook I'll take some mince which is very versatile (chili / Bolognaise / lasagne /shepherd pie) or sausages. With these you can't really go wrong. I always however ask for their bones, with which i make broth. This gives a wonderful winter soup base.
