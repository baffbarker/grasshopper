Oil change in garege near vivo was the ideal excuse to bring hom a Pentium III motherboard and assorted PC cards, two wooden boxes to use as planters next spring, two nice kids books, an Aquarium game similar to the one I loved as a kid - little fishing rods and magnets pull out "fish", and Trivial Pursuit! All there! However it's in German so the odds are against me. This gives me a fair fight against the wife who admits hasn't such widespread knowledge as me (not that mine is of much use though). Could be some interesting battles. Nelieve it or not I never ever played it.
