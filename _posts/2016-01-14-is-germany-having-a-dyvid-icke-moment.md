Right then,

Last night I watched this snippet where this mind blowing man (how much we owe that bloke in the shellsuit from 25 years ago on Wogan) discussed his moment where his view of reality changed. It seems it was like an almost painful blast of lightning into his soul. How do I know what he felt? Because I had the same and yes it hit me like a ton of bricks and I'm decoding it daily.

Yesterday I had a mini-downer. I don't get these very often anymore since I "woke up" and regained my health but it was part of the general winter malaise. I'm starting to understand the meaning and significance of Saturnalia and why it is so important to mark this time of year with food and coming together. The bad spirits which follow harvest time begin to fly around in October (Celtic Samhain) reach their nadir in deep winter. I've resolved next winter to dose myself with St John's Wort tea as I believe it truly is the worst time of the year when our minds and bodies sink to yes devilish depths.

Yesterday I attempted to Google something I'd seen a while back "<strong>Gladio is back</strong>" as my wife came in upset at another Munich tube/UBahn alert which didn't appear on their "LÃ¼genpresse". Things are happening here which they can't handle, whispers everywhere which don't fit the official news they digest nightly (never phone a German at 8:01pm as he is listening to the pompous news). There is an apocalyptic atmosphere here.

We're a bit like the unsinkable Titanic here. We heard a brief knock under the ship but of course this ship is unsinkable isn't it? Everything will be fine. Just play up that orchestra and listen to those violins aren't they wonderful?

Meanwhile those of us from the former-free world (US/UK) who remember a generation shaped by war and survival (Our British parents) begin to think unthinkable things - where will the food come from? Shall I switch from 220V to 12V batteries? Shall I make candles sustainably as they used to? Shall I begin to stock wood and gas bottles? Where will the eggs come from? Will I need horsemanship skills if the car is out of action? Shall I buy small silver and gold coins?

In my cellar lies a beautiful 100 year old paraffin oil lamp. It is the last thing I brought from Britain before my Dad died. It reminds me of the oil crisis in 1973 when the lights were off as was the infernal telly and we were going to bed by candlelight. That time is still in my system and those days may come again...
