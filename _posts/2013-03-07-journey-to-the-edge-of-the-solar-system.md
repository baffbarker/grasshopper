Well I have so many digital projects on the go, and yet I don't even start any of them. Stuff I bought ages ago like digital cameras, a video camera, telescope, guitar added to this all the new junk I've rescued and cleaned up like digital compact cameras, DJ mixing consoles,  an old PS2 box and driving steering wheel.

Time to go back to basics.  If you check out my earlier endeavours with my telescope you will see that I undertook "deep sky" astronomy - hunting down galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters.

In the light of the interesting books I've read in the last few years like <em>Galileo's Daughter</em> by Dava Sobel, Dan Brown's <em>Da Vinci Code</em>, and the Freemasonry astronomy in David McCann's <em>Trapped in a Masonic World</em>, I think it's time to investigate perhaps the same things Galileo did - the moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, and the phases of Venus.

To that end I've dug out my old telescope. Jesus it was a fiddly bugger to set up. However I made a breakthrough today by finding an easier cable adapter to use outdoors - the previous one kept coming apart!
