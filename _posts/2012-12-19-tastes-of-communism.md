Was watching The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and it struck me just how much I identified with the film. I lived in Saudi and learnt to "mind my Ps and Qs" and not to say anything too openly. I flew to Mongolia and fell in love with my wife in the old columns of Communist Party buildings in the rain, and the steppe. We drove a lot in old Communist lands - the fomer Yugoslavia - Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and even Albania with our kids last year. My wife and I drove to Dresden, another ugly Communist city except for its magical Semper Oper. Most of all we spent a lot of time before the kids came in Czech Republic, especially Prague. So I can really relate to the atmosphere of this film very much. 

I must also add that we live just down the road from what used to be an old US military nuclear missile launchpad!
