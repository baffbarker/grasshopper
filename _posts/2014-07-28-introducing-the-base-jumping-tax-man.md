Right then,<div><br></div><div>I have been burning inside to get this out. It is time...</div><div><br></div><div>Hope it comes out right....</div><div><br></div><div>Our world is so full of crime, that only good vigilantes can save us.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My hero is a youngish very athletic base jumper who is connected to a global network of undercover "good" criminals, who in the manner of Robin Hood, steal from the rich and only take enough to survive, then give the rest to very deserving underground causes. Government welfare has failed so our hero is helping in the best way, stealing from super rich criminals each victim painstakingly researched and found to be a disgusting criminal of venal desires, so the crime will be found to be a just one. Usually they tend to be spectacular heists, the victim the owner of a criminally obtained supremely valuable painting, jewel or religious artwork. The guys doing it are already very rich having made good money either from London or the Middle East so the're only in it for the thrill and justice.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>One of them, our hero, likes to BASE jump and slackline. For his balance he likes to do Tai Chi. It's while prefoming Tai Chi in a forest he discovers he can accidentally influence flocking birds. They fly in and feed off the rays of his energy. Usually they fly in to play with him then fly on in a straight line along an ancient ley line. They use the leys to navigate across England's green and pleasant land.</i></div><div><br></div><div>Our heroes are actually really nice guys driven by anger at injustice and global crime.</div>
