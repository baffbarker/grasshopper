I think it is time I spent some time documenting the process by which one transitions through this important life phase. I've developed certain mild phobias over the last few months, not serious but certainly debilitating at times. One of them is the telephone. The other is contact to people.

About four years ago, at 11pm just after reading a story to my kids the phone went and it was my brother. He told me very deadpan that my Mum had been 2 weeks in hospital. Now my Mum was the Powerhouse of the family who held it all together. My Dad was relying on her for care as he was getting more and more frail. The double whammy of fear chilled me to the core.

The worst thing was I had no idea of how to cope as all round me were people who had no idea of the hell I was about to go through. First German culture is different, the attitudes to death, illness and this kind of thing seem different. When someone is grieving here you'd hardly ever know as appearances are everything here. As long as your house looks spotless then how you feel is immaterial. You never even see a coffin or hearse here as the burials are performed inside the grounds of the church. In Britain when we see a coffin in a hearse, no matter who it is, we all stop and if we have a hat on we take it off and bow.

No, the trip to Britain to bury my Dad this spring marked the ending of a four year hell. Until you've been in this boat, it is very hard to explain to the uninitiated in death just how unbearably painful the whole process of losing your parents is. It is like there is a rotten gaping hole in your heart.

The hardest part is that once that hole appears there seems never ever any way to heal it. You can adjust to it and attempt to somehow embrace the pain. It's like every sinew in your body is suffused with sadness.

My attempts to deal with the heartpain involved doing everything they say you ought to do in the circumstances, talking to people - I did but noone out there wanted to know. I went to my doctor and clearly said I help help - tablets or a psychiatrist but none was found. I really believed i was going mad and sometimes I still do. I behave in ways even now which cause stress.and I can't figure out the logic behind my actions, it is like someone or something else is driving me and I am fighting it.

Can anyone else relate to these insane feelings?
