<p>Following on from my recent "Illuminati" posts my descent into the rabbit hole has continued. Thank God my mind is clearer than it used to be! I've been inquiring (or is it enquiring?) into esoteric matters, wisdom and stuff like that and first had to become aware that the stuff I was reading wasn't just "Internet crap" but did in fact exist.</p><p>What I learnt reading online books like "The Dumbing Down of America" and "None Dare Call it Conspiracy" scared me, yet ina way didn't. It led to me reading freemasonry sites which extolled the virtues iof a liberal eduication based upon the Trivium and the Quadrivium. Only by adopting elements of these education systems could a child hope to develop critical thinking skills necessary for them to survive in the new frightening world we will enter, which will sleepwalk us into Communism.</p><p>There have been two articles in the guardian and Teleghraph about Stay at Home Dads recently. If I ever was to write a parenting book, it might travel down the route of:</p><p>1. Developing the health systems of the children through cooking, gardening and exercise.</p><p>2. Promotion of parent's mental health (i.e., not going nuts!) through decluttering and reducing addictions.</p><p>3. Promotion of a child's own education through a liberal arts education, known as the Trivium and Quadrivium. This will help them develop their own tools to see through the bullshit of modern life.</p>
