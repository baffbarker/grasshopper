Over in northen India, I wandered round old British hill stations back in the 90s.  You can still find old British churches there, old British cottages like the Raj never left. One thing the british did was create a garden home away from home, the roses round the door, the works.

I own a garden and I probably followed this path to be honest when I started to develop it. Once you start down this path, you end up questioning everything you put in your mouth, starting with that taste explosion from your first ever home grown tomato. You start to read Michael Pollan and by extension Wendell Berry, other sites such as Path to Freedom.

Anyone remember Toby Buckland? He breezed in, set off a campaing called "Dig In" which gave packets of seeds to anyone who wanted to start off, he started to show people how to dig things, trained the people. That's what's missing in gardening shows, they cover some old bat's hyacinth collection, but they don't show you the HOW so much.

No I still love Monty Don and am  really glad he is back the helm but can't they give Toby his own show of "how to do" stuff?"  Or is that a dangerous concept? It's Not Easy Being Green you know!

Getting into gardening is dangerous as it might lead you into thinking for yourself, caring about your food, health, your family. You nmight even heaven forbid get into permaculture!
