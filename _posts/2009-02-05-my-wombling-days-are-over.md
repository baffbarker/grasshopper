This morning I bein' an early riser at the moment popped down to Vivo our recycling centre to get new bins. They'd left notes on them to say they were "defekt" so in I went. Paid up then went to the fleamarket. There's a fantastic electric bin where I've dug out loads of old computers, plugs and stuff. Much of it ended up back inthere when I got home and found it to be real rubbish but some gems I kept like an old computer. Imagine my dismay this morning when I saw a note forbidding people taking stuff out of it. There's a new regime there which isnt as firendly as it used to be., We've done well out of there. A cheap food processor for example which is pressed into service almost every day, and a free tent with whch we went to Corsica! So it seems that those good old days are over. Sad.
