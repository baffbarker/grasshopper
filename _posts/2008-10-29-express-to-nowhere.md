Ah bummer...the trailer I so coveted is on its way back to its source. Def too shitty to rescue, I yanked off its reflectors and two fine wheels to act as spares for our trips - we currently ride up to 40km which is a record for us at weekend.<br /><br />Other recycling news...the box my neighbour gave me which contained as laser not will as of Feb 2009 contain horse shit. A few bits of wood extra to give a bit of height and hey presto! A patent horse shit "hotbed" for growing early veg in freezing Bavaria!
