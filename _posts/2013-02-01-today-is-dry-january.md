Saw Breakfast telly interviewing people regarding their abstinence program. My question is "why one month?" It takes at least three months to "deprogram" your mind not to want the stuff.

I have been without alcohol since last July and have never felt better. Winter I get out Nordic skiing, summer biking the forests near me. Yesterday when the weather was lousy I was in my gym and after in the sauna. So I look after myself. We all have to.

In my experience it takes a good three months to get yourself off, so if anyone is trying, stick at it!
