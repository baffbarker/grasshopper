Well I had naively believed with my eight hours of sleep yesterday that somehow all was hunky dory and I was not a true member of this little clique. This is yet not the case as I set to sleep last night at 9:30 and woke up at 1am. I am starting to wonder if the preceeding day has some influence over the amount of sleep received.

Wednesday I was lucky enough to be roped in to a very athletic weights and music class at my local gym, a complete spontaneous event to which I was invited and thoroughly enjoyed in the morning. this was followed by a strenuous afternoon gardening at my father in law's house.

However the events of Thursday night messed up this active week. My daughter hurt her head and thus could not make school next day. I thus could not attend my gym to wear myself out. I did fit in a short bike ride with them in the trailer, towing a 7 year old and a four year old are quite tiring, yet it wasn't enough.

Two other factors in the lack of sleep may be telling: I drank a pot of tea at 11am after attending the child doctor with my daughter to check she was okay, and I drank 2 glasses of German "Federweisen" wine with my wife. Perhaps these had some impact.

Here is my theory about how to influence DSPS. I did study a small amount of statistics years ago, including multiple regression. My thinking here is thus:

The amount of sleep is dependednt on several interrelated factors, which may be possible to measure. So here goes, for my situation:

Amount of sleep (S) is a function of caffeine (C) consumed, alcohol (A) consumed, amount of (E) exercise, and presence/absence (Co) of psychological conflict (child tantrum etc). Or to put it mathematically:

S = f(C,A,E,Co)

Thus, is it possible using this idea, to influence and predict the amount of sleep we get? Is this where a sleep diary might help?
