The thought just came to me today munching my lunch, that there must be many men in the same boat as me, namely are fathers in a foreign land. They're either working  for some company in a different land to their own dealing with cultural issues appertaining to their host land e.g., their kids are answering them in the host's tongue, or they're at home fathers in a foreign country, dealing with the inevitable isolation from their peers, like I do every day.

It affects them on several levels:

<strong>1. Psychological health</strong> - the need to belong to a "tribal group". If one is responsible for the care of small children in a foreign culture, one faces huge isolation from natives of the host who though well meaning,  do not share common belief systems or wavelength. Likewise if one is working, one perceives a gap between what he is or was familiar with from his formative childhood nation, yet his children are rooted in customs of the host nation. This might mean they learn local songs, TV programmes the father doesn't understand. This leads to a gulf in understanding and common bond with their children, which is a stress factor.

One method of ensuring the children are immersed, at least in some way, might be to obtain satellite TV of the father's country with a childrens' TV channel, or DVDs in the father's language.


<strong>2. Physical health - food</strong>

The working foreign father has (in my perception) no real problems in this regard if the wife knows her native food, provided he adapts to the local cuisine. However longings may arise for familiar comfort foods from home, which usually on-line companies take care of. However the at home father experiences enormous obstacles when faced with the responsibility for the safe nutrition of his charges, 


<strong>3. Health - medicine</strong>

Very often problems arise with respect to health issues experienced by his children in a foreign culture, the most obvious being language. Medical terms are difficult to understand in English alone, let alone the complication of medical terms. The greatest danger exists when following prescriptions for medicines whilst in charge of the child, and ensuring the correct dosage is administered, as well as communicating the correct symptoms to the doctor. Here language fluency is crucial.


<strong>4. Health - exercise</strong>

Because the mental health of the individual who undergoes the above unique circumstances can be frequently put under pressure, some sort of exercise regime is almost essential for the psychological well-being of the father in this situation. A prime example of a good coping mechanism might be to join a gym, or to begin a running program.


I see the need for:

- some simple "phrase-books" of common on-line terms in each language.

- some input from cross cultural experts on successful coping strategies for dealing with the stresses of foreign fatherhood 
Can anyone think of other ideas?
