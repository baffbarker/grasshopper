Right then,

We Kingdom Watchers (or those who used to live there and wonder how it fares) have for some time been predicting the demise of the House of Saud. Numerous books have been written about Peak Oil such as Matt Simmons "Twilight in the Desert". Now while Ghawar - the biggie field is according to updates I used to read on The Oil Drum, the last Superfield discovered in the 60s and is kind of running on fumes, and panic ensues worldwide, not much attention is being paid to the problem of the water table in the Kingdom. I used to drive a lot around Al Kharj which was back then a beautifully green region. Down there I believe lies the huge water sinkhole of Ain Dhil. Now in the 1960s I heard from expats that you could drop a stone from the surface and hear a splash - about 50 feet I seem to recall. When we visited there with our desert driving group in the 1990s the level was awesomely low, something to my memory about 250 feet down.

So driving the kids to school this morning I came up with a plan. Suppose it were possible to use archive sat imagery to analyse water use in the Kingdom. Back in the old days this kind of data used to cost about 3 grand a pop for four sat tapes, but now the data are out there for free on this site:

<strong>You have no idea you post-Google Earth people of how many turf wars we used to have over datasets like this, and the software which used to be on mainframes where students/lecturers would fight to the career death to gain access to data like this!</strong>

That I believe also includes old Landsat MSS data. If we can download the images of this region and have a peep at water use and greenery in the Kingdom we can gain an impression of what the situation is like today!

I remember trying to explain this phenomenon of what a water table was and why it is important to a Royal Saudi Air Force pilot back in the 90s. I clearly explained why the lowering of the water level at Ain Dhil was a disaster to which he calmly reassured me was no problem. He told me, "we will simply dig another hole".

So it's good to know the place is in safe hands.
