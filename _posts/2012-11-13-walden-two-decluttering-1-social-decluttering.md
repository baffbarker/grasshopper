I think the same here applies for an at-home Dad as for a mother. The need is the same to be alone once in a while to recharge. Children - one's own to start with - are a drain on the consciousness and emotions. My wife and I have had debates whether an only child is more draining than two children. We figured that two kids keep each other company whilst an only one needs attention all the time and needs entertaining. I think if I'd had only one to look after I'd have perhaps gone mad. My two entertzain each other, they argue with each other, struggle with each other - and yet they also laugh a lot together.

Being a decent man I am a walkover when some small kid comes looking big eyed at me to play in our garden with my two. I let many in at first,assuming at some point like when I was small that the reciprocation would soon come - the parents would take mine and host them. But it never came. I waited months more. Nope. It came clear that our garden weas regarded as little more than a public park with me the free babysitter. The worst was when we filled up our inflatable pool and the whole neighbourhood turned out with their towels!

After several years of putting up with this, I put my foot down and said nope no kids are simply walking in to our garden unless I expressly allow it. It was the best thing I did and it led to a significant drop in my stress levels, a private space I could enjoy in my own garden for the first time ever. So my advice if anyone has this phenomenon is to realise how cumulative this stress factor is upon your overall levels of stresss arousal, and take action to remedy it.
