Right then,
<div></div>
<div>Sat here at my keyboard wanting to help.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is where we are going with this:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tweet me the location via GPS phone where the bombs drop.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Later, we'll add to our map locations where water is available and where electric is available via generator/solar.</div>
<div></div>

<div>I'll look at Ushahidi and stuff like that soon.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>I just want a Tweet with GPS lat long in WGS84 and hashtag #mapgaza in it.</strong></div>
