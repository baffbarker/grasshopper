Right then,

It's time to recap if there are a few people out there who don't know what this is about. I am a stay at home Dad living in southern Germany, in a small town between Munich and the Alps. I've done this for the last four years. It is strange, but it was only by going out for a beer - my first in four years - that I realised just how much I had become integrated into German way of life, how much I had learned of the language, and how much I had accepted of the somewhat different ways of thinking which prevail here yet have through struggle, managed to keep up my own cultural identity at the same time.

Much of my work whilst raising kids has focussed on an awareness of the two things I believe to be important when nurturing a family, namely nutrition and exercise, more emphasis was however on nutrition and food. I've become aware not only of the quality of food but almost obsessive about where it comes from, how it is produced and how much energy it took to make what lands on our family table every day.

It started off with an inspiring series of BBC programmes a few years back by the lovely Carol  Klein "Grow your own veg", which led to me knackering my back digging up a chunk of lawn to grow stuff. I duly plopped my seeds in and waited. And waited. Some of it never grew, some did, some bolted, then I planted new seeds then the stuff I'd planted suddenly came up in between the newer seeds - utter chaos. I must have wasted loads of my first produce, as it grew to maturity and I suddenly realised I didn't have a clue what to cook with it.

Enter Jamie Oliver. Being without Channel Four for ages and out of the UK, I had no idea of how big he really was. Sis in law bought me his "Jamie At Home" book for Christmas and off I went.  Fantastic pictures to inspire, and season by season recipes to get one busy as stuff appeared, ranging from asparagus, which is a German obsession when its about, to apple picking and juicing.

I dug out my old Delia Smith book to learn about meat and fish. and became friendly with local producers of these products. An awareness of the quality of these products led to a disdain for supermarket mass food,  and at one point my ill ease with a goose we cooked last Christmas led to an experiment with vegetarianism. It had some impact on our health - I suffered spring tiredness while my daughter I think was lacking calcium, so we went back to meat, but very carefully obtaining it from organic sources where possible. I'm still passionate about food, even more so.

We heat our home with gas and wood fire. Last February we ran out of both at the same time. I've always considered myself a greenish type, yet on this I confess to some hypocrisy. I do leave electric things on, I don't shut doors enough to keep heat in. We've been doing renovation projects on our house every year the last four years. Last spring we changed our windows for more energy efficient ones. It turns out it may be the best thing we ever did and should have done this sooner. So in this blog there is shown an awareness of the frightening potential of peak oil. For those who don't know what it is just Google LATOC and prepare to be frightened....

The only way we will get through Peak Oil is to undertake energy descent and in this respect the Transition Towns Movement is the right way to go. I've become very interested in permaculture and recently obtained a book "Gaia's Garden" which shows how one might undertake small projects on a garden scale. To that end I've already started to build an apple tree guild, circling my apple tree with a daffodils against pests and planting artichokes around the trunk in the hope that the leaves act as some kind of medicine. Additionally I dug up some comfrey to help condition the soil.

In fact I have a related task right now, that if cutting down our plum trees and have to prepare them for the big chop down this weekend.

I've just made a date for the Nikolaus to come to us 5th December. He comes with Grampus the baddie, who will carry the bag of sweets. More about this soon.
