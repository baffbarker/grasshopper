In the car down to Italy I was thinking about the GRASS GIS and how cool this system is to have survived so long since I first came upon it (1992).<br /><br />It has a Bayesian expert system modeller inside which I thought would be fun to apply to the Alps to add to my datasets.<br /><br />Additionally I think of my own GIS analysis in the past, such as the Carneddau thermal modelling we (Ralph Oxley and I) developed way back in c.1991. Could we apply this to Bavaria for example to show areas susceptible to frost for cars in winter? A caveat must be added that it is only for research in these cases and no responsibility for loss of limb or life will result. Would be interesting to seee the reaction.<br /><br />Even my MSc thesis for rainfall prediction could come in. It may be a chance to do real GIS which I have dreamed fof for years but never really did with commercial pressures dictating what I did.<br />Just thoughts.<br /><br />An incredibly kind offer came from Britain today to send by post the VMAP Level 0 data. There are some wonderful people in the world.
