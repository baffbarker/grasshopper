Should you ever be in this tough position, or even heaven forbid be in this boat yourself right now, then send these words over. They genuinely helped me when the sheer naked terror of the two tough pieces of news I received sank into my system, triggering my five year crisis. It's almost two years now since my Dad "went in", and those stormy days seem like another country thank goodness.

They are the words my Dad received when my Mum died, and which I received when my Dad went. The sender is a family friend who was the partner of one of Britain's most famous DJs.

<em>Death is nothing at all</em>

<em>I have only slipped away into the next room</em>

<em>I am I and you are you</em>

<em>Whatever we were to each other</em>

<em>That we are still</em>

<em>Call me by my old familiar name</em>

<em>Speak to me in the easy way you always used</em>

<em>Put no difference into your tone</em>

<em>Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow</em>

<em>Laugh as we always laughed</em>

<em>At the little jokes we always enjoyed together</em>

<em>Play, smile, think of me, pray for me</em>

<em>Let my name be ever the household word that it always was</em>

<em>Let it be spoken without effort</em>

<em>Without the ghost of a shadow in it</em>

<em>Life means all that it ever meant</em>

<em>It is the same as it ever was</em>

<em>There is absolute unbroken continuity</em>

<em>What is death but a negligible accident?</em>

<em>Why should I be out of mind</em>

<em>Because I am out of sight?</em>

<em>I am waiting for you for an interval</em>

<em>Somewhere very near</em>

<em>Just around the corner</em>

<em>All is well.</em>

<em>Nothing is past; nothing is lost</em>

<em>One brief moment and all will be as it was beforeÂ </em>

<em>How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!</em>
