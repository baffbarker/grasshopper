Good progress recently.<br /><br />I read and gained a grasp of basic Mapserver Chapter 1 tutorial. Now we need Chapter 2. One interesting function of theis software is that it allows you to share data as if it were a URL, so users may be able to even link in with say ArcExplorer if they wanted.<br />I downloaded band 8 of the Landsat image for Munich I need for this project. Brovey Transform and data fusion were done. But the imagery coords are wrong. Needs reworking. I processed all of the imagery I have in GRASS. Unfortunately my coordinate system needs an overhaul so I have to redo the work. No problem.<br />I have found the old 1991 DCW dataset at Penn State University. It is good enough for my need shere on my project. However it needs reprojecting. Free solutions?<br />New data source - what is the Geonet data from nima.mil?
