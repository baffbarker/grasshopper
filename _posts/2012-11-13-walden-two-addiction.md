The key to getting a better life is to control addictions. Wikipedia describes it as:

"Addiction is the continued use of a mood altering substance or behavior despite adverse dependency consequences,[1] or a neurological impairment leading to such behaviors."

In my case it was alcohol. Not to the levels of needing a bottle of vodka for breakfast, but to an evening pint and the inevitable shitty feelings it created next day. I knew I had to cut it down. I had indeed been doing this for ages, but I found that drinking light alcohol beer wasn't enough. I had to give it completely up. And that's what I did. 14 weeks off it now and I think I am in the safety zone!

The good news is that I read on the web today that it takes 3 months for your mind to dissociate the feelings of pleasure and beer. I must add I wasn't dependent on it, but I think with my present "clean" state of mind, I think that in general more people are reliant on beer than they realise to keep themselves afloat.
