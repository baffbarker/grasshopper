I've been weighing myself throughout that time and following the trend to see if "sedentarism" - a term I'll coin to denote static lifestyles - impacts upon one's weight. And sure enough, it does. Check the end of this month. Last two weeks stuck indoors with no exercise. That's what it does to you. Spectacular falls following Christmas, then an abrupt halt. An object lesson that we must keep moving.
