The above seems a common theme of people in my boat. I've been drawn to a small shrine near me in a field, with Jesus hanging from a cross. I don't believe he was a supernatural being but I think he was an amazing character who taught beautiful things. One thing stuck me - why did the people do what they did to Him?

As I walked up to the cross, I will swear Mum was in the wind and she sent a shower of hoar frost over my face. Out of the blue came the sudden urge to recite The Lords Prayer which I hadn't done since school. I tried desperately to remember the full words.

I drove over to Dietramszell Monastery and entered the building. I prayed for Mum there too. Then Sunday Bella and I after dropping Elena off at Sara's house rode out to tiny Roggersdorf Church, where we prayed. I just kept uttering "Mum", all the time.
