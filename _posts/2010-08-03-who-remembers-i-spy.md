Right then,

The Graun has made a bit of a prat of itself for not remembering that the phrase "I Spy" has two meanings. The first is that shit "...with my little eye" which I loathe. The second is a fantastic piece of post war nostalgia for many of us.

They were gorgeous little books which cost about 15 pee and were full of stuff to find like Birds and Wild Flowers of Britain. You spotted all the stuff and sent it off to Big Chief I Spy and he sent it back with an "Order of Merit". You ould also join the I Spy Club and get a book with lots of secret codes. Luckily The Mail remembered what I Spy was all about:

...but also seems to be a tad short of memory that it ran the main daily column for I Spy in the 70s, with even a weekly password to get into your own little "patrol" which was supposed to go out hunting for stuff. All lovely fun. Twas the reason I badgered my Dad to receive the august journal, before it became what it is today, barely fitting to be wrapping our fish and chips (oh sorry can't do that any more - elf an' safety)

Anyone else out there remember this wonderful stuff?
