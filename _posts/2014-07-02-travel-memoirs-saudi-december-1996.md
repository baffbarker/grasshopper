Hi,

Well life has been a bit adventuresome recently. I spent last
Weds/Thurs/Fri on a deep desert expedition with friends, led by this
Austrian, who took us to find some limestone sink holes he knew of 260km
from here, We drove straight from work on Weds and camped near this gas
station about 3 hours from Dhahran. It is very cold at night now (though
probably not bitterly cold like UK) – but it definitely isn’t warm anymore.

We rose early next day abd drove across tough sandy terrain. The cars
took a hammering, and sand got into every nook and cranny. My pal Andrew
broke a spring and had to hobble to a village in the middle of nowhere
to get it welded.

We camped up in the dunes a few kilometres from this village. They are
beautiful red ones about 40 ft high, and fun to drive over. It was very
cold again, and I sat round the fire with a blamket round me.

Friday at 8pm we had abseiled 40 feet into this limestone sink hole. The
passageway onward was not obvious, but soon it turned into this tiny body
width crack which I had always sworn I would never do. 100 foot down and
on your tummy for 20 feet! It opened into this beautiful cave system,
with labyrinthal passages, and some chambers big enough to stand in. I
got the photos developed tonight and we weren’t aware how beautiful the
cave was cos we could only see a small bit in torchlight. The formations
are stunning. Stalactites and other limestone shapes.

The journey back was tough driving, and driving 80 kph across this desert
plain I hit a cross track and almost turned over my Lada! It buckled my
wheel rim! As we drove home in the dark we saw two incredible meteors
across the sky.

We have been here 3.5 months now and it has been a long grind. I have
actually worked hard this term, which is a first I’m sure you’ll agree,
and I am tired. Ready for Ramadan in 3 weeks. Life slows down to a day of
10am to 4pm. When that starts, the year is over effectively.

Metal up your a***,

Ever your pal,

J.
