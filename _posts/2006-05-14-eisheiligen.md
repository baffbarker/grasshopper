Today it is Servatius.<br /><br />Damn well cold it was too. Gone were the warm days spent with wheelbarrow in hand with soil from the composting department from Vivo Warngau recycling centre loaded up by a fast huge lorry. I am always amazed at how fast the chap operates his digger. When you pull up near his monstzer he mutters something in deep Bavarian which even my German wife doesn't understand, then proceeds to load up the trailer behind with half a cubic metre of well rotted soil. Spreads well on the garden too.<br /><br />Well today we couldn't go out. Our sweet lady neighbour next door told me yesterday it was Eisheligen. This is an ancient Catholic tradition which states that until these five days are up one should not plant any crops.<br /><br />I have learned this the hard way. A month ago I bought Geraniums planters, fertiliser and the plants themselves in Pennymarkt. A couple of days later they were hammered by the frost. I am not sure if they will fully recover. Yesterday I bought replacements for the ones which were caught in the early frost. I guess the moral of the story is Don't ever buy balcony plants from supermakrets here when they first appear. I shall wait till Eisheiligen now every year for my planting timings.
