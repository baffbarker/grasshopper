<p>(Spoken)<br /> You want to tell me what she was all about?<br /><br /> As I walk in the shadow of Thatcher's death<br /> I take a look at my life and realize there's nothing left<br />Cause I've been smokin' and drinkin' so long that<br /> Even my ma'ma thinks that my mind is gone<br /> But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it<br />Me, be treated like shit, you know that's unheard of<br />You better watch how you talkin, and how you jestin'<br />Or you and your mates might end up in Bryn Estyn<br />I really hate to trip, but I gotta escape,<br />As they smoke I see myself in the line o' coke<br />I'm the kinda man the little kids wanna be like<br />On my guard in the night<br />Watchin families on the TV fight<br /><br /><br /> Been spending most their lives living in the Thatcher's Paradise<br /> Been spending most their lives living in the Thatcher's Paradise<br /> Keep spending most our lives living in the Thatcher's Paradise<br /> Keep spending most our lives living in the Thatcher's Paradise<br /><br /><br /> They got the situation, they got me facin'<br /> I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the strip<br /> So I gotta be down with the hood team<br /> Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams<br /> I'm an educated fool with money on my mind<br /> Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye<br /> I'm a loc'ed out gangsta, set-trippin banger<br /> And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool<br /> Death ain't nuthin but a heart beat away<br /> I'm livin life do-or-die-a, what can I say?<br /> I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-fow'?<br /> The way things are goin' I don't know<br /><br /><br /> Tell me why are we, so blind to see<br /> That the ones we hurt, are you and me<br /><br /> Been spending most their lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise<br /> Been spending most their lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise<br /> Keep spending most our lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise<br /> Keep spending most our lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise<br /><br /><br /><br /> Power and the money, money and the power<br /> Minute after minute, hour after hour<br /> Everybody's runnin, but half of them ain't lookin<br /> What's goin on in the kitchen, but I dont know what's cookin<br /> They say I got ta learn, but nobody's here to teach me,<br /> If they cant understand it, how can they reach me?<br /> I guess they can't; I guess they won't<br /> I guess they front; that's why I know my life is outta luck, fool!<br /><br /><br /> Been spending most their lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise<br /> Been spending most their lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise<br /> Keep spending most our lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise<br /> Keep spending most our lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise<br /><br /> Tell me why are we, so blind to see<br /> That the ones we hurt, are you and me<br /> Tell me why are we, so blind to see<br /> That the ones we hurt, are you and me</p>
