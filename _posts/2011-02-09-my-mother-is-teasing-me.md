Three things have happened here which is very odd. Lots of otherwise reliable electrical equipment is failing. The other day my computer just crashed, when it's normally pretty stable. This morning the kettle although switched on simply refused to work, yet water boiled. The latest is my new Nokia mobile, these I am sure are usually bombproof and simply stopped working at 19:40 am, thus buggering up my timekeeping this morning.

She is still here, cracking small jokes to reassure me, I am certain of it.
