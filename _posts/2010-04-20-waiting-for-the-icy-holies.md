To those not familiar with my situation,

I live at 700m altitude near the Bavarian Alps - I call it Ice Station Zebra. The winters are bitter here, down to minus 20 often - I think I live even higher than Sepp Holzer. The summers are hot - I grow grapes and make wine. We live in the sunniest place in Germany apparently. 

Our primary date for last frost according to local tradition is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Saints">Eisheiligen </a>

It can be warm in April, you plant loads then a frosty snap comes and you can lose the lot. According to a horticulture textbook Adams and Early I own, plants only generally grow when the daily average temp is 6C, so as I know a local weather station I will be asking them for new data for last year to compare.

Another idea came last night I always read my favourite permaculture book "Gaia's Garden" and it inspires me, especially the part about forest gardens. Round my apple trees I have an inner ring of daffodils planted but an outer ring on the drip line might be expensive to buy all those bulbs so I shall use nature. Growing in profusion here are wild garlic Allium ursinum which I intend to try. Far cheaper, more useful and I do love my BÃ¤rlauch pesto in spring!
