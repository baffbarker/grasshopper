I have just remembered the daftest episode of being locked up.

 After my three day Alan Partridge style ordeal in the Novotel, I arrived in Ulan Battar, the capital of Mongolia to meet my host. I was sent in to save Mongolia's soils. My highly important task of which lives (okay soils) were at risk, was to build a highly useful map model of how buggered their soils were and teach the locals how to map this shit. The idea was to sort of land on their beach and have topless native women fall at my feet asking no begging for me to save their souls. Sort of "Let me through I'm a geographer".

 Let's now cut through to me just having been shown my apartment, an unbelievably ugly tenement block just south of the main square, with a scruffy ger (yurt in Mongolian) below my apartment billowing smoke above to my abode. The place was a dump, yet home for the next few weeks while I sorted out the country.

 My hostess left me. I briefly locked my apartment then oh dear! I somehow - no idea how - was suddenly unable to unlock the door! try as I might I could not get out of my apartment. 

 I ended up screaming from the window for my host to come back to let me out of my own apartment. This she thank god, did.

 To this day Mongolia's soils are still in a parlous state. Now you know why.
