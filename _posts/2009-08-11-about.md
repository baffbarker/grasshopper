Gardener, cook, healer, teacher

I'm leaving my old profile below in italics. Since I "rebooted" I have never ever been this healthy. I discovered how to be Â healthy and never want to be ill again. I lost 10kg in months and it's stayed off. I'm on the more spiritual path nowadays, trying to raise two beautiful kids, not taking stuff overly seriously. I grow food, I learnt to cook it well, and I'm slowly learning about healing through herbs/spices/food and Ba Duan Jin Qi Gong. When I feel experienced in the latter I'll help others, but I'm not there yet.

<em>My attempts to develop a veg garden often fail thanks to frost and slugs. I have decided to make my garden a celebration of pests. The slugs are now welcome in the garden, as is the harsh climate. The reverse logic being that when you want them to come they'll bugger off.</em>

<em>And the strategy works. This year there are no slugs, the veg garden is infested with food and looks like a great year in prospect.</em>
