Right then,<div><br></div><div>Two nights ago I had one of my grief meltdowns. Lack of sleep, too much wine and a simply crazy night hyper hyper. Next night (last night) the wife and kids were screaming at each other. My son threw a TV remote at his mother, it missed and hit my poor daughter on the head. All in a night's work as they say.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However when I visited my favourite grocer this morning and she asked how I was I told her "tired" and why she said her family were also yesterday on the ceiling. Ratty with each other, angry and no idea why. Then she said in her Bavarian "It's full moon next few days" and it clicked. I am an objective non-God-bothering scientifically trained bloke who nevertheless always feel bonkers once in a while and realise days after it was full moon.</div><div><br></div><div>So if we could create an app to give ourselves early warning of "Moonmadness" what might it be?</div><div><br></div><div>1. Show when full moon is one the way to give early signs of craziness</div><div>2. Estimate our mood at the time, and of our family as a group.</div><div><br></div><div>Gonna have to get me thinkin' 'ead on!</div>
