I keep in touch with US affairs through the New York Times pullout in the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung given to me by in laws or neighbours who read the SZ. I read of new trends in the States like CSA or Community Supported Agriculture and new interest in farmers markets which I must say enthralls me.<br /><br />My newer interest is in renewable energy and to that end I recently made a toy windmill bur found more links to make a slightly more serious attempt which would light up an LED.<br /><br />Today's casual surf really got me in a spin when I found this Peak thing. <br /><br />http://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/Index.html<br /><br />His argument sounds plausible and I shall watch his site from now on.
