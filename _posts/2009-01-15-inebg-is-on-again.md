One of my favourite TV series "It's Not Easy Being Green" has started up again. The Strawbridge family detail ways to live greener on their series. It is full of stuff on green living, recycling and growing veg.<br /><br />The best tonight was watching them build a clay oven. I am engaged in a War of Attrition on the wife to build such a clay Adobe oven in our garden and am using all manner of threats and incentives including inviting the inlaws to a party with it, to get my devious way. According to the people on the web who've built one you can bake bread and make pizzas with them.<br /><br />The chap who built it emailed me this morning and his website is <a href="http://www.thethoughtfulbreadcompany.com/building_clay_oven.php">here</a>
