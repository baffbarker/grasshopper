It is a new month and I can use up my 1 gig DSL limit and thus I imported the path row relevant SRTM scene as GeoTIFF intot he system. Problem is I have been experimenting so much I need to reorganise the datasets so that all are in one projection. Then the fun can begin.<br /><br />I immediately dived into NVIZ as most GIS people who love 3d would do only to find fault in the quality of the DEM used in this case - it has stepped patterning in it and I need to research why. Ah well at least we are now in the GIS realm not just figuring how to import this stuff.<br /><br />So to recap all VMAP, SRTM and LandÂ´sat data are now downloaded and on my PC in a format useable by GRASS.
