I just had a minor panic with my daughter who's been to see a theatre production with school in Munich. As a foreigner here sometimes I get lost with simple pick-up time instructions - its happened often in the past with all parents aware of the new times just not me and no-one telling me. This time I believed I had it wrong again and asked about. Upon hearing they were back at 1pm instead of 12.30 I fetched my son. Came back for daughter and looked everywhere. The bus was back but no daughter.In a mild panic I drove fast home to seek her.

My relief at seeing her on the pavement was deadened by a flashback to the 1970s when I remember being in a car with my older brother, hunting for my other slightly younger brother. Â´After a big row which was usual in those days, he'd left. My brother was driving to fetch him back. I am just realising that pain I have now is the vary same hole in the heart I had back then.
