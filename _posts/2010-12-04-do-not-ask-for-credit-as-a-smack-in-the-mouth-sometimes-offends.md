This used to be the humorous sign above many small shops in Britain, which sadly reflected the decline in trust between shopkeepers and their customers. While at our bakery here in Germany last weekend, I for the first time in years forgot my cash. The owner was wonderful and simply wrote me a short note of what I owed, and I paid on the subsequent Wednesday.

Isn't it sad that Britain doesn't have that any more?
