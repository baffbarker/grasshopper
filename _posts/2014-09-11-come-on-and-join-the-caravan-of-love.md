Fallen in love with the Eurogypsy lifestyle.

What a way to travel! From southern Spain to Norway, armed with nowt all but a semi-functioning car and a house on wheels behind, it is really the way to go. A slightly more respectable version than clothes peg marketing or proffering a huge sound system blasting out Hawkwind it's kind of the same thing only with clean showers. A more fun and cheap way to see Europe I have yet to find. A car stereo loaded with early Genesis and a hunger for gorgeous sunsets behind limestone palaces sunk with some cheap local Aldi malt brew, sink that then next morning toddle down to the camp shop "Depot de pain" and sank with British tea bags brought along to add a civil touch, all that is perfect I the Eurohippy summer!
