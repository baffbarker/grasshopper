Yes the blog awakes! Lots of news to update on including the Sonnenacker but last news first. The latest exciting addition to the Shrubbery is lemon verbena or lippa citrodora. Deutsch is Zitronenkraut.<br /><br />I'm into a new exciting phase with my plant thing - medicinal uses of plants. Currently administering myself with St Johns Wort and can report a positive outcome.
