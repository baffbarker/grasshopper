As we seem to moor ship late I've had to become adept at cooking in low light situations. The dishes I cook are poor mans variations on those made in my kitchen at home. Normally I'd dig out the pestle and mortar and grind up coriander leaves, even dry roast spices thanks to a Jamie recipe. Out in the field however, you have to improvise and I horror bought some curry paste at a higher end supermarket this evening, threw in a lemon for acidity, and served up a passable curry to the critical crowd. Daughter as usual loved it and appreciated it, other two ungrateful as usual. Thank God they were in the town shopping whilst I made the tasty stuff.
