I was en route to Mongolia via Moscow on an Aeroflot flight in 2000. Because we were an hour late leaving Heathrow, I missed my connection to Ulan Battar and was dumped in Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport basically for 3 days. Eventually I asked for help and was bundled in a van and taken to a Novotel with a locked out floor where they kept all without visas for Moscow. I panicked and rang the UK company who sent me out. we were treated pretty shit tbh, broguht food on a trolley like inmates! I had no clothes as my case was in transit - I washed a T shirt in the hotel washbasin then dried it on a lampshade.

Eventually a brilliant bloke from the British Embassy Moscow came to the hotel lobby and rang me from there, saying that the hotel refused him access to visit me. A diplomatic whatever happened and a few hours later I was bundled in a van to the back of Sheremetyevo, through the packing cases department, lots of doors and this Scottish bloke from the Embassy. He poured lots of beer down me in the "Irish Pub" in the airport and I then dossed on the floor of the airport for 2 days waiting for my Ulan Bataar flight. As there were no showers there I went to the duty free and smothered myself with free test perfume.

Mind you it wasn't all bad news. I waited my time out, then flew to Mongolia for work, ended up meeting a German lady working on the same project and I now live here in Bavaria as a stay at home Dad with her children!
