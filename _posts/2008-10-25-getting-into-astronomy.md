Nice request from "bbulldog" from "The Brits" expat forum has me updating this slightly dormant blog. I want to resurrect this blog again this autumn. Checked out the skies tonight but mist covered all so stayed in and sank a cider for a change.<br /><br />Right how to get started with an ETX once you've bought it? One word, Weasner. Do not pass go and check out Mike Weasner's site for everything you need to know, that the manuals are afraid to print. It's all there.<br /><br />Did I say one word? No two words! Nobody expacts the Spanish Inquisition!<br /><br />The second word is Clay Sherrod! You have to buy a 505 cable which allows you to download Autostar Tours for your handset. Then check out the "Observational Guides and References" section of Weasner, written by Dr Clay. the idea is this. You download the Tour, then print out and read the webpage appertaining to that Tour, ideally take it out and read it by an old red bike backlight like I do.<br /><br />I use Stellarium (www.stellarium.org) to figure out which constellations I will see well for my location. The higher the better generally.<br /><br />For learning about the sky in the absence of a good teacher, I owe a lot to Dr Clay's starting me off. <br /><br />I'd also recommend Burnhams Celestial Handbook to inspire you to find different objects up there.<br /><br />Hope you have as much fun as I have.
