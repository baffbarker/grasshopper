There came this email out of the blue....

Mr. Stocks,
 
I am a XXXXXXXX in the
Marine Science Group at the Research Institute of
King Fahd University.  Some time ago, XXXXXXXX
passed along your resume to me as a potential employee
in our group.  I am quite interested in discussing
this possibility with you and I was wondering if you
would be available for an interview between May 28
and June 8.  I plan to be in the UK during that time
and will be passing through Wales on my way to the
Isle of Man from London.  

Regards,
XXXXXXXXX
