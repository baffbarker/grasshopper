There are two ways of looking at this. The online and the virtual PC itself. 

<strong>Online</strong>

For quite some time I have been disillusioned with Facebook, finding it to be "false" and now I've satisfied myself what my old school frirnds are up to what frutstrates me is I can'tz see them as often as I'd like. This makes me homesick. The trouble with FB is that people don't generally actually do anything worth updating on a FB profile, me neither for that matter. Unless you can put something like Felix Baumgartener wrote on 14 October (jumped out of a balloon today) then the point of FB is actually quite lost. I was briefly a Twitter fan, in particular the "Jimmy Saville" scandal back in the UK, but have since got fed up with it. My addiction to this app was getting bad when I took my mobile to bed with me to chase up the news to the minute. 

Email is another bugbear. On Yahoo mail there is a filter, and I have crap mail sent to a filter inside Yahoo, but with the filter set to catch emails with "unsubscribe" inside them.

I was once a huge user of old fashioned forums like Toytown, but have realised hiow much of a drain they are of your time asnd don't bother writing so much any,

Here's the first hint I can give anyone who wants a faster machine - defrag your hard drive! Download "defraggler" which is better than the usual one and run an analyse on the drive in question. You're looking for 10% of the drive to be free, so that means ona 200Gb drive at least 20Gb ought to be clear, this aids speed. 


<strong>The PC</strong>

I'm a bad hoarder of software for projects I will never ever get round to doing. Being an ex mapping bod, I get software often free such as QGIS, install it and never use it. I'm also guilty of dreaming of being a music and film producer. Cubase, Reason, Rebirth were all on the PC. Photo and video software completed the huge suite. All that heavy stuff went.

A huge chunk of space is wasted by digital pictures, video and music on the PC. I even have some duplicatebut found some scanner which helps to cut that down.
