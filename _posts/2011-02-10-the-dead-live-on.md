As I wrote earlier today was the first day of feeling human, i.e., not absolute shit. I've been physically ill with breathing difficulties and chest pains the last few days, unbelievably irritable and snappy. They are now gone and a slight weariness remains. It may be possible the worst of my trauma is over which began in June last year. I am sure there still lies some shit ahead, notably the funeral, when the unreal reality may hit me.

During my readings on grief I've read somewhere that the dead live on, and this now seems to be my experience. Not in any slight supernatural way (though some surreal things did happen afterwards) but in the loved one's influence on your life. I was at a scrapyard this morning when I smelt oil. It immediately vividly transported me back to the 1970s where next door to our house in Wales was a garage which we rented out to mechanics. The smell which of course I know was so more intense than before this happened that the memories just flooded to the surface. Somehow this systematic shock has triggered old memories of the past. I think that's a wonderful thing as I read people are afraid of forgetting their loved ones. It seems it is quite the opposite. They become an even deeper part of one's awareness by their influence.
