<p>Discovered a newsite The Oil Drum last night. Anyone who is interested in Peak Oil must know that there are two biggie oil fields, one on land and one in the sea. The first is Ghawar and I've driven all over it. The Shedgum escarpment used to be an old camping area for us. How naive I was not to know of the strategic importance of what lay beneath the wheels of my Lada as I drove over it!</p><p><a href="http://satelliteoerthedesert.blogspot.com/2008/01/preface.html">This</a> is one of the most ineteresting GIS/RS links I have come across in ages. Using Google Earth to estimate the wells in Ghawar.</p>
