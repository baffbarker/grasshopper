Right then,

It is that time of ear yet again when the flabs drag their sorry arses down to some newish building in the vain hope of looking like the posters within. As one who used to do this and am in fact underway myself to the gym more to lie in the sauna, I'd like to give my advice:

Don't.

It is a waste of time and money. I only go because I train lightly then for me the main thing is the heat treatment in the sauna.

If you think of yourself as calories in/calories out then focus not on running and puffing your way to a better body but by food. THAT is the key to health. Buy yourself Jamie's new cookbook (brilliant) read up on Leptin, what it does to you, read up on wheat and why dwarf wheat introduced by the Rockefeller via the Indian Green Revolution (not 3ft tall natural wheat) is the reason we are all getting ill, and cut them out till you find alternatives to the crap we are all eating.

It is by changing our food we will change our health. Jamie himself has only recently "got" this, not just me.

For the record, I got on the scales this morning and was a nice healthy 75kg as usual.
