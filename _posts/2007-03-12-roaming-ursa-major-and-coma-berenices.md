Must add that tonight the seeing was awful.<br /><strong></strong><br /><strong>Ursa Major</strong><br /><br />Mizar and Alcor - in the binoculars it is easy to see the double but to see in the ETX the extra double is really beautiful.<br /><br />M51 - A BFT with a star in the middle.<br /><br />M101 - A BFT in my scope.<br /><br />NGC2641 - An elliptical blob with stars visible within.<br /><br />M82 - definite elongated structure discernible in this beautiful object.<br /><br />M109 - couldn't find it. Not visible.<br /><br />M108 - BFT<br /><br />M97 - Owl Nebula . very large BFT.<br /><br /><strong>Coma Berenices</strong><br /><strong></strong><br />I think I noted the asterism Melotte 111 which is a beautiful open gathering of stars located sort of on the backside of Leo.<br /><br />M53 - nice globular cluster.<br /><br />M64 - Black Eye Galaxy. Nice onject. Stars visible.<br /><br />M85 - very small BFT.<br /><br />M88 - not visible.<br /><br />M91 - not visible.<br /><br />M98 - not visible.<br /><br />M99 - not visible.<br /><br />M100 - not visible.<br /><br />To be honest I do not think it was dark enough tonight to see these objects.<br /><br />NGC4565 - BFT.
