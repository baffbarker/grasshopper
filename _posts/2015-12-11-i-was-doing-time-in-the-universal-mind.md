What a prophet this man was! Every time I switch on to my "Chiggy" every single day (my Qi or Chi Gong) workout I drift off into another world. I found standing meditation works not sitting/lying as I invariably fall asleep when doing the latter!

We're all following one of two "light bearers". One of the light bearers resides in the outer plane of the Universal Mind which every time we indulge in some meditation, be it Taoist Yoga (Qi Gong), Tai Chi or meditation, we are accessing the same void the prophets accessed during their sojourns in the great deserts long ago. Accessing truths they experienced and humbling ourselves at the Great Infinite.

If we follow the light bearer "out there" we'll be okay. That is the source of the God Spirit, where the basic Mosaic Laws came from (don't kill, steal etc) and that's ultimately where Heaven really is - it's a mental construct of an ideal we must strive for. I think all the prophets found this out, just their messages became stolen by human intermediaries here on earth, in each faith.

If we follow the light bearer of the Self, we get access to the material world, matter not spirit. we worship the Self, me, I the ego, me me me. I am composed of hormones, testosterone, leptin, adrenaline. I fuck, I eat, I kill.

So let us take time out and learn these practices and we'll rediscover where Heaven is. I may be wrong (and I love to be proved so) but I think most of the religious stories we learned of was masonic allegory, not to be taken literally.
