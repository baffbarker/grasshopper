Ring Tail Galaxy NGC 4038 in Corvus seen. I made a sketch in my book for later identification.<br /><br />M49 - round BFT with a bright centre.<br /><br />M58 - only possible to see with averted vision.<br /><br />M59 - BFT<br /><br />M60 - BFT. Not a show stopper.<br /><br />M61 - BFT.<br /><br />M84 and M86 - pretty formation. They form two angles of an isoceles triangle. Sketch made.<br /><br />M87 - BFT.<br /><br />M89 - Not much to see.<br /><br />M90 - dull object.<br /><br />M104 - Sombrero Galaxy - elliptical shape in a 10 o clock to 4 o clock orienmtation, but no dark lane seen.<br /><br />To be honmest I found wandering the Virgo Galaxy group unimpressive.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Hercules</strong><br /><br />M13 - Beautiful<br /><br />M91 - also beautiful. Smaller but brighter.<br /><br />M3 - bigger, same magnitude as M!3<br /><br />M5 - behind a tree!Discovered the constellation of Serpens. In general I find globular clusters more beautiful then galaxies.
