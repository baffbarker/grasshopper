Somehow my prayers have been answered! Today in the new <a href="http://grass.itc.it/newsletter/GRASSNews_vol3.pdf">http://grass.itc.it/newsletter/GRASSNews_vol3.pdf</a> GRASS Newsletter the exact solution to my question was presented in the form of two papers from Italy and New Zealand! The question was how to use SRTM and VMAP in tandem in GRASS to process the downloaded data.<br /><br />Markus Neteler and M. Hamish Bowman wrote two wonderful papers which guide the way on the subject in hand. They seem as excited about the SRTM/VMAP recent move into the public domain as I am.<br /><br />Meanwhile over in Blighty, the <a href="http://www.systemed.net/blog/entry041216225441.html">http://www.systemed.net/blog/entry041216225441.html</a> New Popular Maps of Britain have been released. Given that free mappers only need often B Roads and paths which haven't changed much in a long time I am sure this is a revolutionary move.
