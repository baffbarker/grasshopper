Today I fried tasty apple pancakes to the Babies, made our own yoghurt with our little machine, racked my own home harvested grape wine, baked a whole meal loaf of bread, and served up a fantastic ham and pumpkin fritatta with a salad.<br /><br />When you wiki exotic words like "fritatta" you learn the essence of the recipe which is basically an aromatic base of onion or leek, then the filling, need not be ham and pumpkin - could be perhaps broccoli and cheese - then pour the herby egg mix over the top then plonk in the oven. Makes me feel like a cook when I've sussed these things out!
