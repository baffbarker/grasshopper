<p>I've spent a lot of time in the "Rabbit Hole" this winter, all since the Savile stuff came out. Have you heard about (or was it you?) who went into the pagan stuff in London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony? I also learned a lot about Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut movie. Here is another good link about MK Ultra:<br /><br />http://pseudoccultmedia.blogspot.de/search/label/Beyonce<br /><br />I also found stuff on the science of steganography - "hiding stuff in plain sight" http://www.garykessler.net/library/steganography.html<br /><br />...and semiotics - the study of signs:<br /><br />http://users.aber.ac.uk/dgc/Documents/S4B/sem02.html<br /><br />All fascinating mind blowing stuff!<br /><br />In order to innoculate yourself against this stuff you might want to check out the Trivium podcasts. I listened to quite a few.<br /><br />This is all heavy stuff, and I can't pretend I've been deep into all of it. A chunk of me needs to "shallow out" of it from time to time I read shallow novels! Come the spring I think my life will be outdoors again and this stuff won't be so much on my mind.Â </p>
