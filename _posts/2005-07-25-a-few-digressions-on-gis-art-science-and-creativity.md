How creative is GIS nowadays?<br /><br />Many years ago I was fascinated with GIS's ability to meld normal soil, geology, slope and aspect maps into one interesting model, say erosion risk for that particular area. I still retain that fascination but have never had the chance to explore that realm of the subject which I regard to be the trues genius of GIS but is rarely ever exploited by the daily practice we carry out<br /><br />Meanwhile back to the home project....<br /><br />Latest problem to solve has been that the HGT format SRTM data so kindly given to me does not read into GRASS so easily. Solution is to download the 15Mb tile from the Landsat path and row of south Bavaria 193-27 from the GLCF dataset next month as my download 1 gig limit may be near its peak.
