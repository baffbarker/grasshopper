My determination to go veggie has brought us some surprises. <br /><br />After walking yesterday round the lovely Hackensee (I call it Nackensee as it is the local nudist lake in summer) I cooked up basically chopped mushrooms in a roux cremy sauce over papardelle which was the bomb. All liked it.<br /><br />Late evening I used up our parsnips in a parsnip and ginger soup recipe which was also delicious. This recipe came from the Vegetarian Society's wesbite recipe page. Another fascinating new taste for our somewhat jaded palette.<br /><br />This evening however after walking to the wonderful Schwarzentennalm we ate Egyptian mujadarra as I outline a few days ago in another post. Full of Bulgur wheat and lentils but nope it didn't "relight the fire" as Take That might sing.
