We are in a period of <span>dauerregen</span> which means for the foreseeable future simply rain. for the first time in my life, now that I am the custodian of a considerabole garden, this is not such a <span>bad thing.</span> Rain means quite simply, that my large areas of grass grow.<br /><br />This afternoon we were caught in the middle of what is typical of Bavaria, a sudden thunderstorm. The blossom which is making my 45 year old apple tree the star of the garden at the moment, suddenly fell like snow as the boughs swayed in the stroung winds  experienced. Until now they have been falling like gentle snowflakes all over the existing lawn.<br /><br />The other stuff falling out of the sky or rather nearby trees, is yellow pollen. I never remember this in Britain at this time of year. Many expats moan about it. My roof windows newly installed are yellow, everywhere is. I had been insopecting the window asI have had a two day running battle with a wasp who was trying to move in under the frame. It was a bit bent, so a bit of bending did the trick and we'll see no more of the persistent little bugger!<br /><br />Imprtant job today was moving the second compost heap. Man it stank!
