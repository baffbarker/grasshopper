Well thanks to me Mum who was out here the freezer is now chock full of stuff to eat in winter.<br /><br />We've got broccoli, fennel bulb, beans, cabbage (loads of that), and courgettes all blanched, bagged and labelled carefully awaiting the work in winter. Couldnt have done it woithout the help of my Mum who gave me a book "will it freeze?" which shows exactly what to do for each vegetable.
