Oh man I feel a bit like a DJ of web snippets in a way. My surfings related to organic stuff have led me through some interesting readings.<br /><p><br /></p>http://www.alternet.org/environment/109576/soil_not_oil%3A_why_we_need_to_kick_petroleum_out_of_our_farms/?page=3<br /><br />Shows how an Indian development org is removing petroleum related machines from its farms.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pfaf.org/leaflets/gdlovene.php">http://www.pfaf.org/leaflets/gdlovene.php</a><br /><br />Is inspiring. I came across a video on the web about Robert Hart's Forest Garden. He set up a forest garden at his farm which provides him with loads of food and herbs.<br /><br />http://www.edibleforestgardens.com/about_gardening<br /><br />is an interesting website devoted to the same idea, of forest gardening.<br /><br />I possess three plum trees in my garden, as well as a hazel. I've been drawn more to these trees this summer and what to do with them. These sites are very inspirational.
