Well I got busy this morning and managed to sow the seeds of the plants recommended in "Gaia's Garden". This should be an interesting semi-scientific experiment to see a tiny food ecosystem building up. I sowed over a 1.5m square bed parsnips, marigold, dill, lettuce and radish. 

In the other bed I sowed spinach, summer savoury, and leaf coriander for those curries!
