Solved the problem of the Landsat datsset I downloaded. The info I need is in the .met file in the download directory.<br /><br />Most data is in UTM. Germany is Zone 32 and all is embedded in the GeoTIFF format.<br /><br />Now we have the info we need to set up the GRASS projection. But we need to set up the EPSG code value somehow....
