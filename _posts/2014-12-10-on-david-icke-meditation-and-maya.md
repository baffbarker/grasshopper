The ability to switch off past hurts and worries about the future is a powerful tool to reach the meditative state, and I must admit I briefly fell asleep, being tired the moment during the latest full "moonmadness" phase. Is tghis possibly the Buddhist&nbsp;</div><div>allusion to Maya where everything is seen as transitory and an illusion?</div>
