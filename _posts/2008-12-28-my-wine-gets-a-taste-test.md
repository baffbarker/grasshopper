You may recall that I picked 9.5kg or 19lb of grapes in summer. rather than do something noble like make raisins or grape juice for us to drink (we tried it and it was too syrupy) I put the juice into a bottle, added an airlock and fermented it three months. I offered some to visiting friends to taste today.<br /><br />"Hmmm...trocken" (dry!)<br /><br />What an accolade!
