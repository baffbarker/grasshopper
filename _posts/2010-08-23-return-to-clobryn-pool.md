Well last week saw me revisiting old haunts under my overall theme of places where I felt happy, and Clobryn Pool was on my list of special magical places, if you read my <a href="http://jeremystocks.wordpress.com/2010/02/01/a-memoir-for-clobryn-pool/">blog post </a>earlier this year, which revelled in glory and wallowed unashamedly in nostalgia for the past.

However it was a visit last week which surprised by virtue of the changes which have taken place in the pool since I was last there. The fishery is now owned by Llandulas Angling Club who seem to have done a marvellous job of improving the place to what was there in 1982 when I was a 14 year old learning my craft. Here are some pics to take us who knew the place down memory lane:
