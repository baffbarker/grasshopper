I have yet to blog about my recent first successful Martinstag experience, yet one German tradition for which we are preparing is upon us, that of Nikolaus.

Being British German we like to combine the bits of each others traditions. Christmas Eve I respect as German so we light lots of candles, open a bottle of Prosecco, and eat salmon and beef on toast in the evening. Christmas Day is British and is a chicken dinner with stuffing and roast spuds - the works.

But the start of Christmas in Germany is marked by Nikolaus which is their form of Santa Claus. This year he is visiting us on December 5th, though his official day is the 6th but we're out then. I've phoned him to come Â then in the evening. He's told me to leave out a piece of paper with each child's name and a good and a bad thing about them this year. He will come aided by Grampus, who is an Austrian traditional character who is the mischievous side of Christmas. As I don't know an awful lot about this part of Bavarian Christmas I think I am just as excited about the visit as the kids!
