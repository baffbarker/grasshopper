When they appeared in my organic box last year I left them to one side, only to unfortunately throw them away later when I couldn't find a use for them. I knew of the existence of the following idea but lacked the confidence to do anything.<br /><br />Years ago I lived in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. My l√∂unch hour was spent in the "Men's" pool - we were strictly segregated - doing 500m then going to the snack bar at out Recreation Center. They'd serve me pitta bread, m'tabbel and a green salad. Well to a neophyte cook these seem complex but now that I feel more confident I have now found a use for these otherwise bitter veg.<br /><br />Simply chuck them in the hottest oven for 40 minutes to bake, then take them out and cut them open. Juice a lemon and peel 3 cloves of garlic. A dessertspooin of Tahini (pureed sesame seeds) and pulse in the blender. Minutes later comes this hummus-y mix which is better than hummus! Thanks to <a href="http://jewishmag.com/104mag/babagnoosh/babagnoosh.htm">this website</a>.<br /><br />I also made some <a href="http://mideastfood.about.com/od/breadsrice/r/pitabreadrecipe.htm">pitta breads</a>. They worked well. Finished off with the simplest lettuce salad thanks to Jamie Oliver's "Jamie at Home" and we had adelicious complete meal which the kids ate too.
