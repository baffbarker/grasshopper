<p>I've long loved the tradition in Germany of lighting candles round a rotating crib which is pushed by heat convection on blades at the top. My father in law used to light his at Advent time, of course one per week till the big day. A few years ago we were lucky to find one for 3 Euros in a flea market in the small village ski resort near to us.</p>
<p>They originate from the Erzgebirge, between Czech republic and Germany, built by miners to raise a few pennies to keep their families through the winter months. The first known were produced around 1850. Additionally to these beautiful objects they also built <em>Schwibbogen</em> which were semicircular candelabras built by the housewives to guide their menfolk home, <em> Nussknacker</em> which were little soldier men which cracked nuts in the mouth, and his little brother the <em>Räucherman</em> who lights up a fag and puffs away! I've just noticed one in fact on our piano. If anyone reads this and requests it I'll take a photo and put it up here!</p>
<p>I must thank Steve "Sin" of Munich for the "helicopter" moniker though!</p>
