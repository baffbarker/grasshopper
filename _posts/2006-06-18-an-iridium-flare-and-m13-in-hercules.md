I was out just now trying to find M3 in Canes Venatici but owing to lack of experience failed as usual.<br /><br />However the eveniong was saved by the sight of an Iridium flare. One phenomenally bright object which faded to almost nothing left of BÃ¶otes. Checked it out with Heavens Above and yep, my first Iridium! Very Happy<br /><br />Thanks for that tip about M13 in Hercules. I just went back out and after some seaqrching, found it! Problem with Hercules is that it has such low mag stars I have always thought it to be a bit of a dull constellation. But now I have seen M13 it has somewhat redeemed itself.<br /><br />I should add that I am simply sitting out on the deck chair with a pair of 10x50s rather than setting up the ETX which I prefer to do in daylight as it is so fiddly. Was caught out tonight by the stunning skies here after last night's thunderstorm.<br /><br />So for to have found Herc and Canes Venatici tonight alone is a privilege.
