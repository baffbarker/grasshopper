According to today's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/oct/19/oil-prices-rise-supply-warning-report">Guardian</a> the <a href="http://www.globalwitness.org/index.php">organization</a> which published Blood Diamond - Global Witness - has published a <a href="http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/1078/1256025340/heads_in_the_sand_final.pdf">document</a> detailing the forthcoming energy crisis. It's good that yet another body other than the IEA has started to trumpet the Peak Oil problem that many doomers have been predicting for years.
