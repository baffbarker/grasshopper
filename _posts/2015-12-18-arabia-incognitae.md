It strikes me that so many people on blogs and sites mention "The Saudis" yet very few of them actually have any idea of the country they discuss. To that end as one who knows the "lie of the land" so to speak I offer here some fascinating maps of the Kingdom made by the USA in 1957. I used these to discover new jebel areas to explore while living out there.

I have to say that day in day out I liked the Arabs, their ways and I got on so well with the majority of them. They are utterly unlike how they are portrayed in our media. Salaam on them.
