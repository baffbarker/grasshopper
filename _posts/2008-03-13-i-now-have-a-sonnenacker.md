Today I signed up for what promises to be an interesting idea. Basically you pay 45 Euros for a 100m long 75cm wide strip of land from Aporil to October. On that you can grow whatever you wish - herbs, fruit, veg or flowers. The rule is basically that you don't put any chemicals or pesticides on the plot and in autumn they plough the old rotted bits into the ground for the next year.<br /><br />So far about 15 people in my town have registered. I am hoping that many will give me tips on what to do as I am "begeistert aber keine Ahnung" - enthusiastic but without a clue! <br /><br /><a href="http://www.unserland.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=326&amp;Itemid=132">Here</a> is a link to the sire in German. Be nice if it caught on elsewhere.
