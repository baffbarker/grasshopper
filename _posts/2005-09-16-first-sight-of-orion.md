Today I can document the first sighting of Orion this winter! When you see that shape beginning to hunt with this dog in the sky you always know autumn and winter are around the corner. Wonderful seasonal feeling.<br /><br />Almost dawn at 6pm in the middle of Munich so light pollution was laughable, but I was able to for the first time put names to those Meade navigation stars, Alnitak, Alnilam and at the right end Mintaka. Beautiful names those.<br /><br />Also prominent in binoculars was the star Sigma Orioni, below Alnitak. I think maybe because of the light pollution.<br /><br />Last but not least is the Orion Nebula. Always beautiful to see but sadly not much depth in binoculars in a city. Can't wait till we are in the country. Not long now.
