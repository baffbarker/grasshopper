Right then,

".<strong>..there is no such thing as society.</strong> There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first."

Now how many people heard the first part of this statement and not the rest? Because there is in my humble opinion, nothing wrong in what she said there. As a father, I'm starting to reassess what the hell happened since my birth year 1967. Perhaps this film will help.

This is an article I wish to evolve over time, but the basic is this. Thatcher was always against Communism, yet she didn't realize until too late that there were Communists in her midst.By then she was kicked out. <strong>She was not actually that clever.</strong>

Most of the ills of the West can be traced to Cultural Marxism from the Frankfurt School in Germany of the 1930s which emigrated to America.
