Right then,

Well I got down to the doc and they told me they'd ran some tests and er... it's like this. Bad news: I've been diagnosed with extreme hypochondria. No known cure except to shut up. Good news is I have perfect kidneys. My diet is perfect apparently. Pity I discovered this a decade after I ought to have done. Something happens to us in between 40 and 50 and as I'm over it pretty much, I'd like to discuss the ways my peers and old friends went through it:

- one bought a 650cc motorbike and crashed it and died.

- one ran an extreme mountain marathon in the English Lakes known as the Bob Graham Round. It's a serious challenge and puts a normal marathon as a sissy game.

- one ran out of 22 years of marriage and flew off to Teneriffe to meet some internet woman.

- one girl at school had emigrated to Australia, then met an old school pal through Faecebook then flew back to Blighty.

So we can see the midlife crisis is real. Something takes over us in these years. It takes a trigger - in my own case the death of my Mum to set it off but you may get it sooner or later. According to the Guardian (which I now hate as a rag btw) the midlife hits whether you have kids or not, it doesn't differentiate.

Since I "got healthy" I like to think of this phase as a reboot, a sort of "control-alt-delete" of life. It's kind of when many corporate blokes realise that the firm they work for is a pile of shite and their work counts for nothing. Some of them drop the lot and "go hippy" traipsing round Nepal. I met dozens of those on my own hippy trail days in Nepal, India and Thailand.

So can we collectively through the Internet help those who haven't yet sorted themselves out?
