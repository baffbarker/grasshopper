Over on my expat website <a href="http://www.toytowngermany.com/">Toytown Germany</a>, a single Dad is asking what to cook on his own, but along comes this <a href="http://www.toytowngermany.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=281480&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=2940599" title="gem">gem</a> from "farmerandy":



<blockquote>Fuck em, I say!! I´ve spent too many christmases alone (working, travelling, separated or divorced) to be arsed putting up with another "lonely single guy" quick fix serving of swill. With the weekend included, that´s a lot of days off this festive season. You owe it to yourself. Sit back in a warm place (will be air-con here, because, apparently, it´s going to be 40 fucking degrees), kick your feet up, slap on some excellent tv (or read a book, if that´s your thing. Just as long as it has lot´s of pictures of titties. Otherwise, what´s the point?) and bask in a warm, self-indulgent, ham-scented, glow....

 All the while sparing a thought for the poor bastards out there (our brothers and fellow men) who will be up in the darkness with screaming, un-controllable, children. Harried all morning by a better half they are really struggling to find something better about, just at the moment. Off to lunch with a bunch of family and relatives they can´t stand. Probably having to stay sober on account of all the driving. home in the evening to put the over-excited and grumpy kids and spouse to bed, only to have said spouse pick the mother of all arguments with them just as they collapse on the couch with that luscious single malt they have been dreaming about for the better part of a year now. 

 And we all know what the poor bastards get in return for this day of undeserving torture, don´t we? 

 Socks, Hankies and peanut-fucking-brittle!!

 So strike a blow for the common man and have a "Feast In Peace". Hell, get a couple of call girls for a nice, accidental, blowjob afterwards. I´ve been reliably informed they don´t have families, so there should be plenty of them on offer on the 25th

 And anyways, it´s not that hard to slap together a christmas feast of epic proportions. Chicks only tell you that it is hard because, well, because they aren´t really good at that much else outside of the bedroom, are they? As the old saying goes - If they didn´t have tits, we´d throw stones at them!</blockquote>
