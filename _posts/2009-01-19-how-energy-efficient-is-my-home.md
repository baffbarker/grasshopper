...and how to calculate it?<br /><br />weekend was spent prettifying out tile stove room. Led to surifng to <a href="http://www.david-online.org/ueber/ueber_index.htm">this page</a>  as I dreamt about log fires and even fireplaces with ovens built in. Sort of a winter version of the outdoor <a href="http://clayoven.wordpress.com/2008/08/29/1-building-a-clay-oven-the-basics/">pizza oven</a> The following post details my efforts to mathemtically ascertain how much energy we are using and how well insulated our hoiuse is. We have the feeling the place is a bit of a Swiss cheese.<br /><br />So this page is worth a look and helps to analyse the <a href="http://www.inspect-ny.com/interiors/Heat-Loss-In-Buildings.htm">energy loss</a> in a building. <br /><br />Last year we decided to insulate our cellar. We bought a load of 50mm thick polystyrene sheets and did the job. At the same time I moitored how much gas and electric we were using every day for a while. However I <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Calculating-the-Energy-Savings-From-Insulation-Improvements&amp;id=1840248">figured out</a> that comparing last winter to this winter might be useless as it is much colder this year round. Enter the concept of <a href="http://www.energylens.com/articles/degree-days">degree days.</a> <br /><br />Using this info which I shall digest when there is more time (like there ever is) I hope to be able to figure out how efficient our building actually is.
